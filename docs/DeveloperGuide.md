## **Design**

### Current increment and command integration

This increment implements inline help and command-specific guidance. The runtime still uses inherited AB3 people and storage. Its active commands are `add`, `delete`, `list`, `help`, and `exit`. Role-aware people, stable IDs, shared lessons, enrolment, attendance, history, and search remain integration targets until their owners' code and complete persistence support are merged. Existing domain use cases and model/storage diagrams describe the inherited implementation or proposed product, not a completed shared-lesson runtime.

`CommandCatalog` is the single registration point for active parsers, short descriptions, and usage messages. `AddressBookParser` extracts the command word and delegates to it. `HelpCommandParser` accepts zero or one topic, normalizes topics with `Locale.ROOT`, and rejects unknown topics and excess arguments with actionable guidance. Help reads command-owned usage constants; it does not maintain a second copy of command syntax.

Feature owners supply their parser, usage and runnable example. Register a mutation only when its aggregate, validation, and save/reload behavior work together. Replace the legacy people entries at the canonical runtime cutover; legacy `delete` must be disabled until guarded canonical deletion resolves the current people-list index to a stable person ID. `edit`, `clear`, and `find` are already withdrawn from dispatch and help in this increment. Their inherited implementation classes remain for incremental cleanup and direct regression tests.

When registering or withdrawing a command, update catalogue/router tests, its UG entry and manual tests in the same PR. A summary topic must never advertise an unavailable command. `list` and `exit` now reject unexpected arguments instead of silently ignoring them.

### Shared-lesson target contract

This records the accepted design in [#60](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/60) and [tracker #59](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/59). It is a shared contract for incremental integration, not a claim that the complete runtime is delivered. The planned canonical data root holds one ordered people collection, one independent Lesson catalogue and separate dated Attendance records.

| Record or relationship | Authoritative representation |
| --- | --- |
| People | Immutable `Student`, `Tutor` and `Parent` records implement `PersonRecord`. `Student` composes `ContactDetails`, education level and parent phone; it does not extend legacy `Person` or own Lesson objects. |
| Shared lessons | A Lesson stores its stable Lesson ID, Tutor ID, weekday/time, subject and room. Its `enrolledStudentIds` owns current membership. A student can join several lessons; several students can join the same lesson. |
| Derived views | Student lessons, lesson rosters and tutor schedules resolve those IDs from the root. They do not create another writable membership graph. Empty lessons remain in the catalogue and shared lessons appear once. |
| Attendance | One key is Student ID + Lesson ID + date. The recorded status is `present` or `absent`; no entry means unrecorded. History is independent of current membership. |
| Parent links | Separate Parent records are optional. Derive links only when a Parent's own phone exactly equals the Student's parent phone, including leading zeros. A Student's parent phone does not require a matching Parent record. |

**Confirmed person-selector boundary:** `INDEX` and `STUDENT_INDEX` arguments use a positive one-based position in the current filtered **people list**, following AB3's command-input convention. This applies to deletion and to the student selector for enrolment, unenrolment, attendance, history, and student-specific lesson retrieval when those routes are integrated. An index selects the card at that position in the current people view, not that position in the unfiltered collection, a lesson roster, or a lesson/history result. Validate the range and required role, then resolve the index once to the selected record's stable `PersonId` before invoking Model or query APIs. Reuse that resolved ID throughout the operation; later view refreshes must not select another record by reinterpreting the index. Lesson creation has the separate named-tutor lookup described below, which also resolves once to a stable ID.

Stable person IDs such as `S1`, `T1` and `P1` remain displayed, stored, and used by internal lookup, queries, relationships and persistence. Cards distinguish the current-view index from the stable ID. Filtering or reordering renumbers the people view from one without changing stored identities. Stable lesson IDs such as `L1` remain displayed and persisted; all command references to an existing lesson use `lid/LESSON_ID`, for example `lid/L1`. Lesson catalogue, roster and history results use separate views and preserve the current people filter, order and indices. Their row positions never replace people-list command selectors.

The planned lesson-catalogue filter is `lessons [si/STUDENT_INDEX]`. Its optional student selector follows the same current people-list index and Student-role validation, then passes the resolved stable ID to the internal student-lesson query. Internal Student-ID query APIs remain ID-based. This planned route is not yet active.

**Tutor selection:** `addlesson` resolves `tu/TUTOR_NAME` as a normalized full name, ignoring letter case and repeated spaces. Optional `tp/TUTOR_PHONE` must match the tutor's exact phone number; never ignore a supplied phone to fall back to the name. Reject zero matches or ambiguity without changing data, and request a disambiguating phone when needed. Search `tu/` instead matches a case-insensitive name fragment. Tutor-category name search uses `n/`. Stable person IDs are not external lookup selectors for these commands.

The planned routes follow the [UG command conventions](UserGuide.html#reading-the-planned-command-formats) and [summary](UserGuide.html#planned-command-summary):

| Action | Format |
| --- | --- |
| People | `add r/ROLE ...`, `list [r/ROLE]`, `delete INDEX` (role-specific required fields are in the UG) |
| Create lesson | `addlesson d/DAY st/HHMM et/HHMM s/SUBJECT tu/TUTOR_NAME [tp/TUTOR_PHONE] rm/ROOM` |
| Enrol / unenrol | `enrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID` / `unenrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID` |
| Delete lesson | `deletelesson lid/LESSON_ID` |
| Catalogue | `lessons [si/STUDENT_INDEX]` |
| Lesson detail | `showlesson lid/LESSON_ID [d/YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Mark / correct | <code>mark STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID d/YYYY-MM-DD s/present&#124;absent</code> |
| Unmark | `unmark STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID d/YYYY-MM-DD` |
| History | `history STUDENT_INDEX [lid/LESSON_ID]` |
| Search | `search c/CATEGORY [FILTER_PREFIX/VALUE]...` |

The complete [search matrix](#supported-criteria) remains the planned target. Own-contact searches can be integrated first, followed by the relational families. Each delivered route advertises only its available filters; staging does not silently remove the remaining filters from the target. Documenting a route does not activate it.

**Scheduling and attendance rules:**

* Create a lesson independently with an empty roster. Reject tutor or room clashes between distinct lessons on the same weekday. Check a student's clashes against their other enrolled lessons when enrolling; another student joining the same lesson does not book the tutor or room again.
* Treat times as half-open intervals `[start, end)`: `1600–1700` and `1700–1800` are adjacent and allowed. Overlap requires `first.start < second.end` and `second.start < first.end` on the same weekday; equal times on different weekdays do not clash.
* Unenrolment removes only current membership and retains dated attendance. New attendance requires current membership and a real date matching the lesson's weekday. An existing historical key can be corrected or unmarked after unenrolment; repeating its status does not create a second entry. Unmark removes the dated record, not membership. Unrecorded is the absence of a record, never a third stored status.

**Deletion guards:** Reject a blocked deletion without changing data; never cascade to linked records.

| Record to delete | Guard or retained data |
| --- | --- |
| Student | Block while any Lesson roster or Attendance record references the Student ID. |
| Tutor | Block while any Lesson references the Tutor ID. |
| Lesson | Block while its roster is non-empty or Attendance references its Lesson ID. |
| Parent | Preserve every Student's parent-phone value; derived links disappear when the Parent record is removed. |

All mutations go through Model APIs using stable identities after command-boundary resolution. Complete aggregate copy/reset/equality and independent snapshots cover people, lessons, memberships, attendance and monotonic allocation state; deleted committed IDs are not reused. Vincent coordinates validated versioned JSON and transactional saves; failed saves must restore data and active views before those commands are enabled. The canonical runtime cutover must connect a compatible people view, index resolution, guarded commands and persistence together. Do not persist displayed indices or introduce a second people store; verify that separate lesson/roster/history results preserve the people view used by the next command. Preferences remain separate. Capacity, waiting lists, make-ups, export, saved searches, archiving, richer attendance statuses or notes, attendance percentages, fees, lesson editing, occurrence cancellation, undo/redo and guided advanced search are future extensions.

**Iteration boundary:** The [Week 8 course instructions](https://nus-cs2103-ay2627-s1.github.io/website/schedule/week8/project.html) call for small first increments towards the simplest MVP. Each member should aim for a meaningful reviewed and merged code PR. An individual feature need not be complete end-to-end, but intermediate versions must remain working; this iteration requires no product release. The broader team target remains visible in [tracker #59](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/59). Carry unfinished work into v1.3 honestly. Compatible loading and rollback remain safety requirements when a mutation is activated, rather than a requirement to finish every planned feature in Week 8.

The [AboutUs ownership record](AboutUs.html#project-team) assigns people/testing to Zhu, lessons/enrolment/attendance to Yang, queries/views to Ben, storage/history/delivery to Vincent, and help/documentation coordination to Ernest. Each owner authors their own feature documentation in the existing UG/DG as behavior is delivered. Ernest reconciles shared conventions and examples without taking ownership of those implementations.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because it displays `Person` objects from the model.

At the planned canonical people-view integration, cards show the current filtered people-list index separately from the stable person ID. A separate lesson, roster or history result must not replace or renumber that people view. These requirements describe the integration target; the inherited `Person` UI remains active in this increment.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* `AddressBookParser` delegates to the registered parser in `CommandCatalog`. An `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`) uses the other classes shown above to parse the arguments and create an `XYZCommand` object. The router returns that object as a `Command`.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

For planned canonical person commands, parse a positive index and resolve it against the current filtered people list at execution, checking the selected role. Capture the stable person ID once before calling ID-based Model/query APIs. The inherited `delete 1` example selects the first person in the current people view; the planned guarded route retains that input convention while using stable identity internally.

#### Read-only retrieval API contract (#113)

`Logic` now declares the UI-facing retrieval methods below. This increment defines their signatures and read-only
result shapes only. Until the canonical Lesson, Attendance and aggregate stores are integrated, every new method in
`LogicManager` throws `UnsupportedOperationException` with `Shared-lesson retrieval is not implemented yet`. No new
command or view is active, and the inherited people list continues to work.

| `Logic` method | Planned result and ordering |
| --- | --- |
| `getLessonList()` | All shared lessons in creation order, once each, including empty rosters. |
| `getFilteredLessonList()` | Active lesson-filter results in catalogue order, once per lesson; an empty match is valid. |
| `findLessonById(LessonId)` | Lookup in the full catalogue regardless of filter; a valid unknown ID gives `Optional.empty()`. |
| `getStudentLessons(PersonId)` | The student's current lessons, derived from Lesson-owned enrolled student IDs, in creation order. |
| `getLessonRoster(LessonId)` | Current students resolved through the people registry, in people creation order; an empty roster is valid. |
| `getTutorSchedule(PersonId)` | Assigned lessons, including empty ones, by weekday (Monday first), start time, then numeric lesson ID. |
| `getAttendanceHistory(PersonId)` | All recorded dates for a student, newest first, then numeric lesson ID. |
| `getAttendanceHistory(PersonId, LessonId)` | The same retained history restricted to one lesson, regardless of current enrolment. |

Java callers pass `PersonId` or `LessonId`, never a displayed row position. After integration, null IDs are rejected,
an unknown or wrong-role ID for a list query is rejected, and an existing record with no matching results yields an
empty list. `findLessonById` alone uses an empty optional for an unknown lesson. The current declaration stubs throw
before validating arguments. At the command boundary, `lessons si/STUDENT_INDEX` and `history STUDENT_INDEX` resolve
the one-based position in the current people list once, check the Student role, and then pass that record's stable
`PersonId`. Existing lessons are selected by prefixed `lid/LESSON_ID`. These result views preserve the people list,
its filter and its command indices.

The `model.query` interfaces describe projections rather than persisted records. `LessonView` exposes a `LessonId`,
assigned tutor `PersonId` and current name, `LessonTimeSlot`, `Subject`, `Room` and current roster size.
`StudentView` exposes a student `PersonId`, current name and level, required parent phone and optional own contact
fields. `AttendanceHistoryEntry` exposes the student ID, lesson ID, date, recorded present/absent status and a separate
current-enrolment flag. An absent attendance entry is unrecorded. History survives unenrolment because its source is
the attendance store, not the current roster. Each projection describes one model state; changed records replace
entries in the observable lists.

All list results will be unmodifiable observable views. The canonical Model will own query derivation, filtering and
refresh, while `LogicManager` exposes the results. A list object already held by the UI must remain subscribed after
lesson/person changes, enrolment, attendance changes and successful rollback; refresh entries only after a committed
change, or restore the pre-command results on failed save. Retrieval does not save data, alter identity allocation, or
replace the people view. Search still enters through `Logic.execute(String)` and must follow the complete
[`SearchField` matrix](#supported-criteria), including same-student/same-lesson matching when those slices land.
Lesson creation resolves a normalized full tutor name; search `tu/` matches a partial tutor name.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the `Person` objects selected by the current filter, such as search results, in a separate _filtered_ list. It exposes this list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Person` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Person` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


#### Canonical data aggregate (#76)

`PonHubData` holds one immutable `PonHubDataState`: ordered people and their per-role allocation
history, shared lessons and their rosters, dated attendance, and the last allocated lesson sequence.
`exportState()` returns a stable snapshot; copy construction and `resetData(...)` safely share immutable
state. Replacing one container's state cannot change any previous snapshot or another container.

Snapshot construction copies incoming lists and rejects duplicate IDs/attendance keys, missing or
wrong-role references, and lesson IDs beyond the supplied counter. Historical attendance does not
require current enrolment. Equality includes records, collection order, rosters and allocation history,
including deleted IDs. Zero means no allocation; `Long.MAX_VALUE` means exhaustion, matching the people
registry convention. Counters are preserved as supplied, never reconstructed from retained records.

Read methods expose immutable collections and stable-ID/key lookups. The controlled replacement boundary
accepts only a validated state; invalid construction or null replacement leaves the current state intact.
Feature owners must preserve committed allocation history when preparing normal changes. Restore may
reinstate earlier counters for rollback. Lesson allocation and global tutor/room scheduling are supplied by
the #78 API below. Enrolment, deletion and attendance-editing policies remain separate feature work.

This aggregate leaves `ModelManager`, commands and JSON storage unchanged. Vincent owns snapshot/storage
contracts; Zhu/Yang will prepare validated changes through one future Model adapter, and Ben can consume
the read-only queries. UI filters, selection and preferences remain outside the operational snapshot.

#### Shared lesson scheduling model APIs (#78)

`PonHubData.addLesson(tutorId, timeSlot, subject, room)` is the controlled lesson-creation seam. It resolves the
stable ID against the aggregate's people snapshot and requires an existing Tutor. It derives the next positive
`LessonId` from `lastAllocatedLessonSequence`, creates one empty-roster `Lesson`, builds a complete candidate
`PonHubDataState`, and installs that state only after validation succeeds. Deleted committed IDs are therefore
not reused. Exhaustion at `Long.MAX_VALUE`, a missing/wrong-role Tutor, or any scheduling conflict leaves the
catalogue and counter unchanged.

Every complete `PonHubDataState`, including a restored or deserialized candidate, enforces the same global
schedule invariant. Two lessons whose half-open slots overlap on the same weekday are rejected when either
their stable Tutor IDs match or their normalized `Room` values match. Empty lessons participate in this check.
Adjacent intervals, different weekdays, and simultaneous lessons with both different Tutors and different rooms
are allowed. Tutor names are deliberately irrelevant to clashes; room equality uses `Room`'s locale-independent
upper-case normalization.

The aggregate exposes immutable relationship snapshots for retrieval and deletion integration:

| API | Contract and owner use |
| --- | --- |
| `getLessons()` / `getLesson(LessonId)` | Canonical catalogue order and stable-ID lookup, including empty lessons. |
| `getLessonRoster(LessonId)` | Current Students resolved from Lesson-owned IDs in global people creation order. |
| `getStudentLessons(PersonId)` | Current lessons derived from roster IDs in catalogue creation order. |
| `getAttendanceForStudent(PersonId)` / `getAttendanceForLesson(LessonId)` | Retained attendance references in aggregate storage order; neither depends on current enrolment. |
| `isPersonReferenced(PersonRecord)` | Predicate for Zhu's guarded people deletion: Student roster/attendance and Tutor lesson references block removal; Parent links remain derived. |
| `isLessonReferenced(LessonId)` | Guard for Yang's lesson deletion: a non-empty roster or retained Attendance blocks removal. |

`PonHubData` owns normal lesson allocation and atomic state installation. `PonHubDataState` owns whole-root
identity, reference and scheduling validation. `Lesson` remains the immutable record and sole owner of roster
membership. Ben may build projections only from the read APIs; they never mutate records or counters. Vincent's
serialization must preserve the supplied catalogue order and lesson allocation counter, construct the entire
candidate snapshot before replacement, and use its validation rather than installing partial arrays.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

#### Safe JSON saves

Address-book data and preferences share a UTF-8 file writer. JSON serialization finishes before writing.
Existing destinations are resolved to their real paths, so saving through a symbolic link updates its
target and preserves the link. Dangling/cyclic links and inaccessible destinations fail before writing.
New files use a resolved parent directory, creating missing directories as needed. Concurrent external
changes to links/files and multiple application instances are not coordinated.

A complete temporary sibling file is written and closed before atomic replacement is attempted.
Only `AtomicMoveNotSupportedException` selects the fallback; permission and other move errors propagate.
The fallback first copies the existing destination into a unique sibling `.ponhub-backup-*.bak` file.
If backup creation/copy fails, replacement is not attempted. After a failed ordinary replacement, the
writer restores the old bytes from that backup (or removes a partial destination for a first save).
If restoration also fails, the complete backup is retained and its path is included in the error;
restore it before continuing or restarting. Never delete such a backup without recovering its contents.

After success, backup cleanup is best effort: a cleanup failure is logged without reporting the committed
save as failed. Other cleanup failures are suppressed on the primary error. Parent directories or
recovery/temporary files can remain after failures or abrupt termination.

The fallback permits saving on filesystems without atomic moves, but is not atomic: concurrent readers
can observe an incomplete destination during replacement/recovery. Its guarantee is a recoverable old
copy, not uninterrupted access at the original path. Neither path promises power-loss durability or
preserves all previous file attributes. Save failures still do not roll back in-memory command changes;
that is separate transaction work. Help, list and exit skip operational saving. Preferences retain
their separate shutdown lifecycle. Future read-only commands must also bypass operational saving when activated.

#### JSON version detection foundation

`JsonDataVersionDetector.detect(String)` classifies file contents using the existing Jackson dependency,
without constructing Model objects or writing files. The current loader uses this gate before decoding. The planned
PonHub envelope reserves `schemaVersion` as a positive JSON integer, initially `1`; this is a data-schema
version, independent of the application version. Issue #79 will define and validate the remaining envelope.

| Result | Meaning and later loader action |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `LEGACY_AB3` | An unversioned object containing a `persons` array and, optionally, the textual `_comment` used by AB3 fixtures. No other root fields are accepted. Contact validity is not checked and roles are never inferred; preserve it for manual upgrade. |
| `PONHUB_V1_CANDIDATE` | Explicit integer `schemaVersion: 1`. Continue to complete envelope/domain validation; this result alone never authorizes loading or saving. |
| `INVALID_VERSION` | An explicit version is null, blank, a string, boolean, collection, fractional number, zero or negative. Reject without coercion. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` | A positive integer other than 1, including values beyond Java integer range. Reject even if `persons` looks like legacy data. |
| `UNRECOGNIZED_FORMAT` | A non-object root or an unversioned object that does not match the legacy root, including extra unknown fields. Reject rather than ignoring fields. |
| `MALFORMED_JSON` | Empty/invalid JSON, duplicate object keys or trailing content after the document. Reject ambiguous input. |

Missing versions identify legacy data only for the strict legacy root shape. A versioned candidate can
still contain missing or invalid records: the detector is a format gate, not a schema/domain validator.
Callers must handle file absence and read errors separately; neither is equivalent to empty JSON.
The current `JsonAddressBookStorage` classifies and decodes the same string. It accepts only legacy AB3
roots in this runtime and rejects every other classification, including version-1 candidates until their
codecs are integrated. Missing files retain the existing fresh/sample-data behavior. Only a confirmed
missing path is treated as absent; denied access and dangling final symbolic links are loading failures.

#### Current protected startup

On a controlled loading failure, `StorageManager` records recovery guidance and locks operational saves
for the rest of the session. `MainApp` creates an empty display model, not a replacement writable store.
The UI displays a recovery warning; `LogicManager` allows only help/list/exit and bypasses saving for
those commands in the protected session. Other commands are rejected before execution. Storage also
rejects direct operational saves, while preferences retain their separate lifecycle. Deleting or fixing
the file while the session is running does not unlock it: recovery requires a restart.

JSON syntax, root/version errors, invalid contact records and I/O failures become controlled loading
errors. Explicit checks reject null person/tag entries; unrelated programming errors are not swallowed.
Valid legacy contacts still load and save normally. This safety increment does not implement the new
aggregate codec, automatic migration, general command rollback or no-save behavior in normal sessions.

Manual check: in a disposable working folder, place malformed JSON, `null`, or a versioned document in
`data/addressbook.json` and record its bytes. Start the app and verify the recovery warning. Run help,
list, exit and attempt add/delete; restart as necessary. The original bytes must remain unchanged and
mutations must be blocked. Close the app, preserve the original, then restore a known-good compatible
backup or correct JSON/access permissions and restart. Confirm valid human-edited legacy data loads.
`ProtectedStartupTest` exercises the startup/command/storage boundary and original-byte preservation;
`UiManagerTest` verifies the warning without requiring a real window.

#### People-only canonical JSON storage (#79)

`JsonPonHubDataCodec` converts between a complete `PonHubDataState` and the version-1 envelope below.
`JsonPonHubDataStorage` reads one UTF-8 document into a validated candidate and uses the existing safe
file writer for saves. These classes are not wired into startup, commands or the legacy storage path;
protected runtime integration remains #84. Preferences remain in their existing separate file.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "people": [
    {"id": "S1", "role": "STUDENT", "name": "Alex", "level": "P1", "parentPhone": "00123456"}
  ],
  "personCounters": {"STUDENT": 1, "TUTOR": 0, "PARENT": 0},
  "lastAllocatedLessonSequence": 0,
  "lessons": [],
  "attendance": []
}
```

People array order is global creation order. Roles are `STUDENT`, `TUTOR` or `PARENT` and must agree with
the stable ID prefix. Every record requires `id`, `role` and `name`. Students additionally require `level`
and `parentPhone`; tutors and parents require their own `phone`. Optional `phone` (for students), `email`
and `address` are omitted when absent, never encoded as null. Contact values are strings, preserving
leading zeros. Unknown fields and role-inappropriate fields are rejected rather than silently discarded.

All three person counters and the lesson counter are required nonnegative integers up to `Long.MAX_VALUE`
(exhaustion). They include deleted identities and must not be recomputed from retained records. Person
counters must cover every retained ID. Both lesson/attendance arrays must currently be empty: non-empty
collections are rejected on both read and write until #81/#83 supply their codecs. They must never be
dropped while rewriting a file. Serialization finishes before any filesystem write.

Close the app and preserve a backup before manual editing. For example, adding `"email": "alex@example.com"`
to the student above is valid; making a phone numeric, removing a required field, or lowering its student
counter below 1 is rejected. Object field order and whitespace do not matter. Round-trip tests compare the
complete snapshot, including optional-field absence, people order, deleted-ID history and exhausted counters.
Loading classifies the version first and validates all records/counters before returning; callers install
the candidate only on success. Loading itself never writes or changes live state. This codec supplies no
legacy migration or rejected-file session lock; the existing protected startup remains independently active.

#### Planned protected loading and legacy upgrade

These are requirements for the first canonical cutover, not behavior delivered by the inherited loader. Keep the inherited runtime until the compatible canonical Model, codecs, people commands and protected loader are activated together. The new runtime must classify the configured file before decoding: missing data may start a fresh supported root; valid supported versioned data loads only after complete domain, identity and reference validation. Unreadable, corrupt, unsupported-version and unversioned AB3 files produce controlled errors, actionable recovery guidance and no operational writes to the rejected file. Preserve its original bytes through help, list, exit and attempted mutations; saving preferences remains separate.

The initial upgrade policy is deliberate backup and manual re-entry into a separate new supported store. An unversioned AB3 contact does not contain enough information to infer a Student, Tutor or Parent role, and a Student additionally needs its level and parent phone. Do not invent those values, discard invalid records, or convert the original in place. Once the canonical build is available, tell the administrator to close the app, preserve a backup of the original data folder, deliberately start that compatible build in a separate empty folder, and re-enter records with explicitly chosen roles and required fields using the delivered commands. The preserved original and backup are not operational write targets; only the explicitly chosen new supported root is writable. Check the new records before retiring the old working folder. A migration importer and application-level export are future extensions; this policy does not introduce an `import`, `export` or `recover` command.

The contact changes in #61 can reject formerly accepted numeric-only names, long phones or slash-containing addresses, or reveal duplicates after normalization. Diagnose the affected values without overwriting the rejected data. Inspect the local JSON read-only; if the older build is needed to inspect contacts, use an additional working copy, never the preserved original or backup. The administrator supplies any corrections and missing role information. Correctly human-edited supported JSON must load: document the delivered schema, preserve valid stable IDs and allocation state, and validate all relationships without requiring users to avoid editing the file. An invalid edit is rejected as a whole with its bytes preserved. The [planned manual checks](#planned-canonical-loading-and-recovery) cover this boundary.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Lesson scheduling value contracts

The lesson scheduling foundation is represented by immutable value objects in `model.lesson`. These objects validate and
normalize scheduling input before later lesson commands or persistence code use it:

* `LessonId` is a stable identifier consisting of `L` followed by a positive `long` sequence number. Lower-case prefixes
  are normalized, leading zeros are rejected, and advancing beyond `Long.MAX_VALUE` fails explicitly instead of wrapping.
  The canonical aggregate owns allocation state so committed IDs are not reused.
* `LessonDay` accepts the case-insensitive abbreviations `Mon` through `Sun` and stores their canonical display form.
* `LessonTime` accepts exactly four digits in 24-hour `HHMM` format and retains leading zeros when displayed.
* `LessonTimeSlot` combines one weekday with a start and end time. Its end must be strictly later than its start, so
  overnight lessons are rejected. Slots are treated as half-open ranges: `[start, end)`. As a result, adjacent slots do
  not overlap, and equal time ranges on different weekdays do not clash.
* `Subject` contains 1–50 letters, digits or spaces after trimming and reducing repeated spaces to one.
* `Room` contains 1–10 letters or digits. It is normalized to upper case so room comparisons do not miss clashes because
  of letter case.

These value types do not activate or advertise a lesson command. The canonical aggregate now supplies lesson creation,
global tutor/room clash checks and ID allocation; command and persistence integration remain separate increments.

### Immutable shared lesson records

`Lesson` represents one canonical recurring teaching slot. It stores a stable `LessonId`, one tutor-role `PersonId`,
the validated `LessonTimeSlot`, `Subject` and `Room`, and the set of currently enrolled student-role `PersonId` values.
An empty roster is valid, and several students can refer to the same lesson without duplicating its tutor, room or
schedule. Student records contain no copied `Lesson` values.

The constructor defensively copies the roster and rejects Tutor or Parent IDs in it; the assigned tutor must have a
Tutor ID. `getEnrolledStudentIds()` exposes an unmodifiable snapshot. `withEnrolledStudentIds`,
`withEnrolledStudent`, and `withoutEnrolledStudent` return replacement `Lesson` values, leaving the original lesson
and its stable identity unchanged. Equality, hashing, copying and string representation include every stored field,
including roster membership. The canonical aggregate owns lesson ordering, ID allocation and clash checks,
while persistence and duplicate-enrolment command feedback remain separate work. This dormant record does not change
the active runtime.

### Inline help

`HelpCommand` returns guidance in an ordinary `CommandResult`, with no separate-window or exit flag. It never mutates Model data, filters or preferences. `LogicManager` returns help, list and exit results before the operational save path, so these commands work even when operational storage is unwritable and do not create or rewrite the data file. List still resets the visible people filter and exit still returns its exit flag. Add/delete continue to save; general change detection and rollback remain separate integration work.

The Help menu and F1 invoke `MainWindow.executeCommand("help")`. Both display exactly the same guidance as typed help while retaining the command-box draft and person selection. `ResultDisplay` uses a read-only wrapped TextArea with scrolling and resets to the beginning of each new result. Existing F1 handling for focused text controls remains in place. The unused inherited HelpWindow is not constructed or reachable through supported help entry points.

Tests exercise each registered help topic and its example through the actual router, malformed topics, locale-independent matching, filter/data/preference preservation, and help with failing storage. GUI selection, menu/F1 and scroll behavior have a separate manual procedure below.

<a id="person-record-foundation"></a>
<a id="ordered-people-registry-foundation"></a>

### People records and identity

Immutable `Student`, `Tutor` and `Parent` records implement `PersonRecord` and compose `ContactDetails` rather
than extending legacy `Person`. Constructors enforce the record's role and required fields; absent optional
contacts remain absent. Students do not contain copied lessons or attendance. Relationship ownership and
optional parent-record linking follow the [shared contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract).

| Role | Required data | Optional data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student | Student ID, name, education level, parent phone | Own phone, email, address |
| Tutor or parent | Matching role ID, name, own phone | Email, address |

`EducationLevel` accepts `P1`–`P6`, `S1`–`S5`, `JC1` and `JC2`, normalizing to uppercase. `PersonId` is a
role-prefixed positive `long` identity, such as `S1`, with no leading zeros; trimmed constructor input is
case-normalized. It survives contact and view changes. Value equality includes the ID and all stored fields.
Business duplicate matching instead compares **role + normalized name + identifying phone**: parent phone
for a student, own phone for a tutor or parent. Name case and repeated spaces do not distinguish duplicates;
different IDs, optional contacts or student levels cannot bypass this rule. Different-role records are distinct.

<a id="registry-apis"></a>
<a id="allocation-and-state-validation"></a>

[`PeopleRegistry`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/PeopleRegistry.java)
keeps all roles in one global creation order and returns immutable snapshots. Successful additions append a
record and advance only its role's allocation counter; rejected additions change neither. If the last Student
allocation was `S2`, deleting it keeps the counter at `2`, so the next Student receives `S3`. Counters are never reconstructed
from surviving records, even when a role becomes empty. `Long.MAX_VALUE` means exhausted: allocation rejects
before overflow.

`PeopleRegistryState` defensively copies that ordered list and the complete three-role allocation map. It
rejects unsupported record types, duplicate IDs/business keys, missing or negative counters, and counters
below retained ID sequences. Copy/import/export preserve order and deleted/exhausted allocation history;
independent registries share only immutable records. The canonical root uses this state for persistence and
restoration; its actual format is described in [Storage](#people-only-canonical-json-storage-79).

<a id="deletion-and-activation-boundaries"></a>

Registry removal consults the caller's relationship predicate before changing data. Unknown IDs, references
or a failing predicate leave order and counters unchanged. The predicate must query the canonical relationships
without mutating the registry; complete deletion guards follow the shared contract above. This seam does not
activate the guarded deletion command.

### Contact validation and normalization

Shared contact value types validate construction at parser and JSON-loader boundaries, preventing commands
and saved files from admitting different formats.

| Value | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Name | 1–100 characters after trimming/collapsing ASCII spaces; English letters, spaces, apostrophes, hyphens and periods, with at least one letter. Display case is preserved. |
| Phone | 3–15 ASCII digits, stored as text to retain leading zeros. |
| Email | At most 254 characters; local part allows letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `%`, `+`, `-`, without leading/trailing/consecutive periods. Domain has at least two letter/digit/internal-hyphen labels, ending in 2–63 English letters. Spelling/case are preserved. |
| Address | 1–200 printable ASCII characters after trimming/collapsing spaces; `/`, tabs, line breaks and controls are rejected. |

Name/address normalization occurs once in the value type, before equality and hashing; case remains significant
for value equality. Name/address parser boundaries preserve controls for rejection; role-aware add rejects
controls before extraction.
Space normalization scans linearly; email rejects excessive length before a linear, constant-stack format scan,
avoiding stack overflow on hostile repeated input. Phone/email parsing retains surrounding-whitespace trimming.

The active inherited `add` parser and loader use this policy. Previously accepted files outside it, including
normalization-created duplicates, enter [protected startup](#current-protected-startup); Storage describes
rejected-file preservation and recovery. This contact-policy change performs no legacy migration. Role-aware
commands remain dormant as described below.

<a id="role-aware-addition-parsing-foundation"></a>
<a id="staged-person-addition-candidate"></a>
<a id="current-people-index-resolution-foundation"></a>

### Prepared people commands

`RoleAwareAddParser` returns immutable, ID-free `PersonAdditionInput`, using the shared contact policy above.
It accepts lowercase prefixes once each in any order; role and education-level values ignore case.

| Role | Required prefixes | Optional prefixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student | `r/`, `n/`, `l/`, `pp/` | `p/`, `e/`, `a/` |
| Tutor or parent | `r/`, `n/`, `p/` | `e/`, `a/` |

Supplied optional values must be nonblank. Unknown/repeated prefixes, student-only fields on other roles,
preambles, line breaks and controls are rejected. Unicode whitespace is accepted at prefix/value boundaries,
while interior contact characters still follow the shared validators.

[`PersonAdditionCandidate`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/PersonAdditionCandidate.java)
prepares a complete proposed `PonHubDataState` using a temporary registry. It applies duplicate/allocation rules
and appends the new person while preserving lessons, rosters, attendance and lesson allocation history.
Preparation changes no live state or counter; an abandoned candidate reserves no identity. The transaction
must **prepare from a fresh snapshot → save the complete compatible candidate → install**, then report success
and reset the people view to all roles. This helper supplies no save, rollback or UI action.

`PersonIndexResolver` applies the [shared selector contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract) to the authoritative
current people list. With students `[S4, S9]`, positions `1` and `2` select those IDs; position `2` never means
`S2`. Resolve once and retain the returned ID throughout the operation. Student-only resolution rejects a
Tutor/Parent at that position without searching another list; range/role failures leave data and view unchanged.

These commands remain preparation for [#85](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/85). Registry,
aggregate, view and people-only storage foundations are merged; failed-command/save rollback and protected
canonical loading still gate coordinated loader/add/list/card activation on one root. The active catalogue
continues to use inherited add/delete/list; `list r/student` is rejected. People-only storage cannot save nonempty
lesson/attendance collections until their codecs arrive; see Storage above. Legacy delete must retire at cutover
until guarded canonical deletion is available.

<a id="role-filtered-people-listing-foundation"></a>
<a id="prepared-person-record-cards"></a>

### Prepared people view and cards

[`PeopleView`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/PeopleView.java)
derives the people projection from one supplied `PonHubData` root and owns the selected role filter. It retains
one unmodifiable observable
list for both command selection and `PersonRecordListPanel`, preserving global relative order. The root emits
no change events: its owner explicitly refreshes after committed replacement or rollback, on the JavaFX
application thread when controls are attached. Refresh retains the selected role; parse list arguments before
changing it. A successful addition's reset to all roles belongs to the transaction above.

For detached feedback, `PersonRecordListData` copies an immutable snapshot and supplies numbered entries,
count and an empty message; it does not observe later changes. `PeopleListParser` accepts empty arguments
or one `r/student|tutor|parent` value, with case-insensitive role names, and rejects malformed arguments without
changing any view.

`PersonRecordCardData` separates the numbered name heading from the role/stable-ID line and renders the
required/optional fields in the role table above; absent contacts show `Not provided`. Display case and phone
zeros are retained. `PersonRecordCard` loads wrapping labels from FXML with no fixed card height.
`PersonRecordListPanel` fits cards to cell width, updates positions when cells are reused, and supplies count,
empty placeholder and vertical scrolling for tall cards. Neither projection nor panel owns writable records.

The view/panel/cards are dormant; `MainWindow` still constructs inherited cards. Display acceptance and
coordinated wiring remain [#77](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/77). Developer preview recipes
and earlier viewport results are preserved there; application checks appear in [manual testing](#planned-people-card-display-checks).

<a id="prepared-canonical-people-sample-checks"></a>

### Representative canonical people samples

[`PeopleSampleDataUtil`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/PeopleSampleDataUtil.java)
creates a fresh independent registry in deterministic order `T1, S1, P1, S2, T2, S3`, using normal addition rules.
It supports representative acceptance work without duplicating validation or allocation logic.

| Records | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `S1`, `S2`, `P1` | Siblings share parent phone `00987654`, matching Pat Tan's own phone; optional Student contacts are absent/present. |
| `T1`, `T2` | Both tutors are Mei Lim with distinct phones; one omits email/address, exercising future name/phone disambiguation. |
| `S1`, `S3` | Same-name Alex Tan students with different parent phones remain distinct. |

Phone zeros and email case are preserved. These samples are dormant and contain no lessons, enrolments,
attendance or file format. [#101](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/101) preserves the developer
fixture recipes and tracks full-product samples and acceptance after runtime integration.

### Search criteria parsing foundation

Issue #64 adds an independently testable search specification. `SearchCriteriaParser.parse(String)` consumes the
arguments after a future `search` command word and returns immutable `SearchCriteria`. It is a criteria parser rather
than an implementation of `Parser<T extends Command>`, because this increment produces a value object instead of a
command. Runtime routing and help topics will be connected with the later search commands.

`SearchCategory`, `SearchField` and `SearchCriteria` are in `seedu.address.model.search`. The specification has no model,
UI, storage or lesson-record dependency. `SearchField` owns the prefix/category matrix and validation rules;
`SearchCriteria` defensively copies its filters, exposes an unmodifiable map and supplies field-level matching.

#### Supported criteria

The required category is `c/student`, `c/parent`, `c/tutor` or `c/lesson`, ignoring category-value case.
Category-only input is valid and imposes no field restrictions. Prefixes are lowercase, may occur in any order and
may appear only once, including `c/`. This matrix implements the earlier search specification tracked in [issue #64](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/64):

| Prefix | Field | Student | Parent | Tutor | Lesson | Matching |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| `n/` | Result person's name | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Partial text |
| `l/` | Student education level | Yes | — | — | — | Exact level |
| `p/` | Result person's own phone | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Exact digits |
| `pp/` | Student's parent phone | Yes | — | — | — | Exact digits |
| `e/` | Email address | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Partial text |
| `a/` | Postal address | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Partial text |
| `sn/` | Associated student's name | — | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial text |
| `d/` | Lesson weekday | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Exact weekday |
| `st/` | Lesson start time | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Exact HHMM |
| `et/` | Lesson end time | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Exact HHMM |
| `s/` | Lesson subject | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial text |
| `tu/` | Lesson tutor's name | Yes | Yes | — | Yes | Partial text |
| `rm/` | Lesson room | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial text |

Text queries are stripped of surrounding whitespace and stored in lowercase using `Locale.ROOT`. Matching uses
case-insensitive substring containment, so `n/al` can match `Sally Tan`, `s/Math` can match `Add Math`, and
`e/@example` can match `mei@example.com`. Text fragments are accepted without requiring a complete valid name,
email address or lesson field. `tu/` remains a partial tutor-name query; tutor-category name searches use `n/`.

Phone filters require 3–15 ASCII digits, retain leading zeros and match the complete number. Levels accept only
`P1`–`P6`, `S1`–`S5`, `JC1` and `JC2`, normalized to uppercase. Weekdays accept only `Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed`, `Thu`, `Fri`,
`Sat` and `Sun`, normalized to lowercase. Times require four digits from `0000` to `2359`, with valid minutes.
Start or end may be supplied independently; when both are present, end must be later than start on the same day.

`SearchCriteria.matches(SearchField, String)` checks one supplied condition. An omitted filter imposes no restriction;
an absent optional field fails a supplied filter. Exact-field comparisons use the same validation/normalization as
the queries. Query integration must combine all supplied filters and preserve the existing same-student/same-lesson
rules. This foundation validates relational criteria without traversing records or building a relationship graph.

#### Errors and integration boundary

The parser throws `ParseException` for missing/unknown categories, unexpected preamble, blank values, repeated
prefixes, unknown prefixes, category-incompatible filters, invalid exact values and non-increasing time ranges.
Slashes in values and line breaks in arguments are rejected. All prefix-shaped tokens at whitespace boundaries are
recognized, including unknown ones: `c/student n/Alex xyz/no` reports unsupported `xyz/` instead of absorbing it into
the name query. Horizontal whitespace can separate prefixes. Programmer-supplied null arguments raise
`NullPointerException`; direct construction of invalid criteria raises `IllegalArgumentException`.

The parser and criteria operate only on their inputs and perform no writes, ID allocation or filtering of live
lists. Tests cover every documented prefix/category combination, normalization, partial/exact matching, retained
phone zeros, day/level/time boundaries, unknown/blank/repeated fields, time ranges and criteria immutability.
The active router still rejects `search`. The full matrix above is the retained planned search contract, including
partial tutor-name queries and relationship filters. Own-field search can be activated as an earlier slice; later
relational slices must retain same-student/same-lesson conjunctions and distinct-ID results. For example, a parent
search combining `sn/Alex` and `s/Math` must find a matching lesson for that same linked Alex, rather than use one
child for the name and another for the subject. A student's combined day/subject filters must match one enrolled
lesson. Lesson results must count each shared lesson once and include empty lessons when the supplied filters allow
them. Feature owners update routing, help and guides for each activated slice without reducing the outstanding target.

### Dated attendance records

`Attendance` is a separate immutable association record; it is not nested in a Student or Lesson. Its unique
`AttendanceKey` combines one student-role `PersonId`, one `LessonId`, and one `LocalDate`. The remaining stored field
is `AttendanceStatus`, whose only recorded values are `present` and `absent`. A missing key means unrecorded, so no
`unrecorded` status is stored. Current enrolment also remains outside Attendance, allowing dated history to survive
later unenrolment.

External dates are parsed using strict ASCII `YYYY-MM-DD` syntax and calendar validation, including real leap years.
Status parsing is case-insensitive. Wrong-role person IDs, impossible dates and unknown statuses are rejected.
`withStatus` returns a replacement record for the same key and leaves the original unchanged. Equality and hashing
include all three key components and the status, which lets the later canonical aggregate keep one record per key and
replace its value when correcting attendance. This foundation adds no active command, collection or persistence route.

### Future undo/redo and archiving

Undo/redo and student archiving are future extensions. The inherited AB3 undo diagrams and `VersionedAddressBook` example do not describe an implemented PonHub mechanism. No undo, redo, archive or restore route is registered in the current command catalogue.

Failed-command rollback is part of safe canonical integration and is separate from user-requested undo. A future undo or archive design must preserve shared-lesson and attendance references, stable identity and the rule against reusing committed IDs. Feature owners will document its actual commands and persistence behavior if that extension is implemented.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Tuition centre administrative staff who maintain student, tutor and parent records and coordinate lessons and attendance.

* **Usage context**: During enrolment, timetable planning and daily lesson administration, staff need to find contacts, allocate tutors and rooms, record attendance, and follow up on absences and lesson changes.
* **User characteristics**: Staff understand tuition operations and work repeatedly with names, contact details, student levels and lesson schedules. They need quick record retrieval, clear feedback on invalid changes, and command examples while learning the application.
* **Current problems**: Keeping contact details, schedules and attendance consistent requires repeated checking. Staff need to avoid tutor or room clashes, find the right parent contact promptly, and identify missed lessons that need follow-up.

**Value proposition**: For tuition centre administrative staff who need to keep people, lessons and attendance organised, PonHub provides a single place to manage and search these records, with scheduling checks and attendance tracking to support reliable daily administration.

Compared with maintaining separate contact lists, timetables and attendance records, PonHub connects the information needed for routine tasks and checks conflicting or invalid changes. Planned requirements such as make-up booking extend this support to absence follow-up.

**Shared-lesson MVP target:** Lessons are created independently of student enrolment, including lessons with empty rosters. Each shared `Lesson` owns its currently enrolled student IDs; student lessons, rosters, and tutor schedules are retrieved from that canonical membership rather than copied into each student. Attendance is a separate dated record for one student and one lesson. Unenrolment removes current membership and retains attendance history; an existing historical entry can still be corrected or removed. A missing attendance entry means unrecorded, distinct from present and absent.

**Delivered versus planned:** The [student foundation (#57)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/57), [tutor and parent foundations (#62)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/62), [ordered people registry (#70)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/70), [person-card components (#119)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/119), [role-filtered listing components (#122)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/122), [search criteria foundation (#64)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/64), and [lesson scheduling values (#63)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/63) provide independently tested APIs. The registry, new cards, and role-filtered listing remain dormant. [Inline help (#68)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/68) and [safe file replacement (#66)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/66) are connected to the active inherited contact runtime.

Canonical people and shared-lesson runtime integration remain tracked in [#76](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/76), [#77](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/77), [#85](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/85), and their dependent command, storage, and retrieval issues. Compatible persistence, protected loading, and failed-save rollback remain activation gates. The requirements below describe the intended product; they do not claim that role-aware commands, shared lessons, enrolment, attendance, or history are currently available. Each feature owner updates implementation evidence and feature documentation as those increments are delivered.

### User stories

These stories describe the broader shared-lesson target and future ideas; they do not imply completed functionality or require every High-priority story to be delivered in Week 8.

Priorities: **High** (core shared-lesson target), **Medium** (future extensions), **Low** (future consideration).
The target includes shared rosters and regular enrolment. Capacity, make-up reservations and waiting lists are future work, as are export, saved searches, archive/restore, richer attendance and percentages, fees and guided workflows. Medium and Low priorities remain proposals for later iterations.

Shared lessons, current membership, and retained dated attendance are separate concepts in these stories. The stories specify user goals; command selectors and the complete planned search-filter matrix are confirmed in the [shared-lesson target contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract) and [#60](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/60). Implementation proceeds in working increments, and only the [active command routes](#current-increment-and-command-integration) are available today.

### Use cases

For the use cases below, the **System** is `PonHub` and the **Actor** is the tuition centre administrator.
The person, shared-lesson, attendance, search, and help operations accept all required details in one keyboard-entered command. These are target use cases; only the routes listed under [Current increment and command integration](#current-increment-and-command-integration) are active today. Canonical mutations validate and save the complete change without requiring a field prompt, preview, or separate confirmation. Read-only retrieval does not save operational data. Guided previews, capacity, make-ups and other explicitly labeled future extensions are outside the core flows.

Person selectors in these target use cases are positive indices from the current filtered people list. Resolve the selected record once to its stable ID and enforce any required Student role; another result view does not supply that index. Existing shared lessons are selected by `lid/LESSON_ID`. Creating a lesson uses a normalized full tutor name and optional exact phone; search uses partial tutor-name text.

#### UC-01: Add a person record

**Related user stories:** US-01, US-02, US-03, US-14, US-15, US-30, US-34

**Preconditions:** PonHub is running. The administrator has the person's role and required contact details.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters one `add` command containing the selected role and all required person details.
2. PonHub validates the command, normalizes the details, and checks for an exact duplicate.
3. PonHub saves one new person record, refreshes the person list, and reports success.

**Extensions**

* 1a. A required field is missing, invalid, repeated, or unsupported: PonHub explains the problem without changing data. The administrator may correct and resubmit the command at step 1.
* 2a. An exact duplicate exists: PonHub rejects the addition without changing data, and the use case ends.
* 2b. The administrator explicitly requests a planned guided preview: PonHub shows the normalized record and any possible duplicate matches before saving. The administrator cancels with no change, or confirms and resumes at step 3.
* 3a. Saving fails: PonHub rolls back the addition, reports the failure, and the use case ends.

**Postconditions:** On success, one valid, non-duplicate person record is stored and visible. Existing records are unchanged.

#### UC-02: Find and review operational records

**Related user stories:** US-04, US-05, US-06, US-16, US-17

**Preconditions:** PonHub is running with the relevant canonical records and retrieval routes integrated. Available search filters are documented for the delivered slice.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `list`, `lessons`, or one `search c/CATEGORY` command with any available filters needed.
2. PonHub validates the request and retrieves the relevant records, combining relational filters according to the same-student/same-lesson rules.
3. PonHub displays each distinct match once in the documented order, with its count and relevant relationship context. People results replace the current people filter and are numbered from one; lesson results preserve that people view.
4. To review a shared lesson, the administrator reads its stable ID from the results and enters `showlesson lid/LESSON_ID`, optionally with `d/YYYY-MM-DD` for dated attendance.
5. PonHub displays the current roster and requested dated attendance without changing operational data or the people list. For a date, missing attendance is shown as unrecorded, separately from present or absent.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator runs `lessons si/STUDENT_INDEX`: PonHub resolves the current people-list index once to a Student ID and shows that student's current lessons. An invalid index or wrong role is rejected without altering records or the people view.
* 2a. A condition is invalid, unavailable in this slice or incompatible with the category: PonHub explains the supported syntax without changing data. The administrator may resubmit at step 1.
* 3a. No record matches: PonHub displays a successful empty result, and the use case ends. Unfiltered catalogue retrieval includes shared lessons with empty rosters.
* 4a. The lesson does not exist or the date is invalid: PonHub reports the error without changing data or the people list.

**Postconditions:** The requested read-only view is displayed. Operational data is unchanged; lesson and roster results preserve the current people filter, order and indices.

**Future extensions:** Sorting/grouping controls, guided search, spelling suggestions, export and saved searches belong to US-22, US-29 and US-38 to US-41. They are not steps required by this core flow and have no promised command syntax here.

#### UC-03: Create or delete an independent shared lesson

**Related user stories:** US-08, US-09, US-10, US-20

**Preconditions:** The tutor exists. PonHub has loaded the shared lesson catalogue and tutor/room bookings; compatible mutation and persistence support is integrated. Creating a lesson does not require a student.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `addlesson d/DAY st/HHMM et/HHMM s/SUBJECT tu/TUTOR_NAME [tp/TUTOR_PHONE] rm/ROOM`, supplying a full tutor name and an optional exact phone number.
2. PonHub resolves exactly one tutor by normalized full name and, when supplied, exact phone. It validates the remaining values, same-day time range and proposed slot against that tutor's bookings and room bookings.
3. PonHub saves one independent shared Lesson linked to the tutor's stable ID, allocates its stable Lesson ID, starts an empty roster, refreshes relevant views and reports success.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator instead enters `deletelesson lid/LESSON_ID`. PonHub finds that shared lesson and checks both its current roster and retained attendance references. If neither exists, it removes and saves only the lesson, releases its tutor/room booking and reports success. Surviving lesson IDs do not change; the use case ends.
* 1a1. The lesson has enrolled students or retained attendance: PonHub blocks deletion, identifies the dependency and changes nothing. It does not cascade into student or attendance deletion.
* 2a. A value is missing or invalid, or no tutor matches the full name and optional phone: PonHub explains the problem without changing the schedule. A supplied phone is never ignored to fall back to a name-only match.
* 2b. The tutor or room has an overlapping booking on that weekday: PonHub rejects the addition and identifies the conflict. Adjacent half-open intervals are allowed.
* 2c. Several tutors match the name without a disambiguating phone: PonHub rejects the command and requests `tp/TUTOR_PHONE`. The administrator checks the intended tutor's phone and resubmits the complete command. No student selector is part of lesson creation.
* 3a. Saving an addition or deletion fails: PonHub restores the complete prior data and active views, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** One clash-free shared lesson with an empty roster is stored, or one unreferenced lesson is removed. Adding a student later does not recreate the lesson or book its tutor/room again. Failed operations preserve the prior schedule and allocation state.

**Future extensions:** Lesson templates, edits, replacement tutors, one-occurrence cancellation and automatic today views are separate later requirements (US-27, US-28, US-36, US-37 and US-47).

#### UC-04: Enrol or unenrol a student in a shared lesson

**Related user stories:** US-17, US-18

**Preconditions:** The Student and shared Lesson exist. The administrator has listed or searched people and checked the intended student's current position. Canonical membership mutation and persistence support is integrated.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `enrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID` using the student's current index in the displayed filtered people list and the lesson's stable ID.
2. PonHub resolves the index once to a Student ID, validates the role and lesson, rejects duplicate membership and checks for overlap with that student's other enrolled lessons.
3. PonHub adds that Student ID to the shared lesson's roster, saves the complete change and refreshes derived student lessons and roster results without replacing the people list.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator instead enters `unenrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID`. PonHub resolves the Student once, requires current membership, removes only that membership and saves it. Dated attendance remains available; the shared lesson and student remain stored.
* 2a. The people-list index is out of range, selects another role or the lesson does not exist: PonHub explains the problem and changes nothing.
* 2b. Enrolment duplicates current membership or conflicts with the student's timetable, or unenrolment targets a non-member: PonHub rejects the change without modifying data.
* 3a. Saving fails: PonHub restores the previous aggregate and active views, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** Current membership reflects the successful command; dated attendance and stable identities are unchanged. Tutor and room bookings are still owned by the one shared lesson and are not repeated per student. Failed operations preserve prior data and views.

**Future extensions:** Capacity limits, remaining places, waiting lists, swaps and one-off make-up reservations are outside this core membership flow (US-19, US-24, US-25 and US-48).

#### UC-05: Record, correct or retrieve dated attendance

**Related user stories:** US-11, US-12, US-14, US-21

**Preconditions:** The Student and shared Lesson exist. The administrator has listed or searched people and checked the student's current people-list position. Canonical attendance and persistence support is integrated.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `mark STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID d/YYYY-MM-DD s/STATUS`, using `present` or `absent` and the student's current filtered people-list index.
2. PonHub resolves the index once to a Student ID, checks the role and validates the lesson, real date, weekday and status. A new attendance key requires current enrolment; an existing key can be corrected after unenrolment.
3. PonHub creates or updates the one record keyed by Student ID, Lesson ID and date, saves the complete change, refreshes dated attendance results and reports success. A missing record is unrecorded, not absent.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator instead enters `unmark STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID d/YYYY-MM-DD`. PonHub resolves and validates the Student, lesson and date, removes only the existing dated record and saves the change. Current enrolment and the shared lesson are unchanged. Existing historical attendance can be unmarked after unenrolment.
* 1a1. No entry exists for the specified key: PonHub reports that there is nothing to unmark and changes nothing.
* 1b. The administrator enters `history STUDENT_INDEX [lid/LESSON_ID]`. PonHub resolves the Student once and displays their retained dated attendance, optionally filtered by the shared lesson. History includes former enrolments and preserves the people list. This read-only request does not save operational data.
* 2a. The index, role, lesson, date, weekday or status is invalid, or a new mark has no current membership: PonHub rejects the command and explains the problem without changing data.
* 3a. The same status already exists: PonHub reports no change and performs no operational save.
* 3b. A different status exists: PonHub corrects that key instead of adding a duplicate, including after unenrolment.
* 3c. Saving a mark or unmark fails: PonHub restores the previous aggregate and active views, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** A successful mutation stores one authoritative status for the key or removes only that key. History remains independent of current membership. Failed operations preserve attendance and views; remaining attendance references still block student and lesson deletion.

**Future extensions:** Feedback, late/excused statuses, notes, bulk/clickable attendance, percentages, make-up links and fee adjustments are not core attendance promises (US-26, US-43 to US-46, US-48 and US-49).

#### UC-06: Delete an unreferenced person

**Related user stories:** US-07

**Preconditions:** The target person exists. The administrator has listed or searched people and checked their current position; canonical guarded deletion and persistence support is integrated.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `delete INDEX` for the target in the current filtered people list.
2. PonHub validates the positive index, resolves it once to the stable person ID and checks role-specific dependencies: Student membership or attendance, or Lessons assigned to a Tutor. Deleting a separate Parent does not remove a Student's stored parent phone.
3. PonHub deletes and saves only the eligible person record, preserves the current filter, refreshes displayed positions and reports success. Surviving stable IDs and relationships remain unchanged.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The index is invalid or dependencies prevent deletion: PonHub identifies the problem and changes nothing. Linked records are never deleted automatically.
* 3a. Saving fails: PonHub restores the prior aggregate and people view, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** One eligible record is deleted without broken references, or the previous state remains unchanged. Recheck displayed positions before selecting another person.

**Future extensions:** Optional previews, student archiving/restoration and undo are separate later requirements (US-23, US-31 and US-35), rather than supported alternatives to this command.

#### UC-07: Get help and recover from a command-entry error

**Related user stories:** US-13, US-32, US-33, US-42

**Preconditions:** PonHub is running and the command interface is available.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `help` or `help COMMAND` in one command.
2. PonHub displays the command catalogue or the selected command's syntax and examples.
3. The administrator enters a complete command using the guidance.
4. PonHub validates and executes the command, then displays its result.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The administrator needs only the help catalogue: PonHub leaves the current records and selection unchanged, and the use case ends.
* 2b. Guidance exceeds the Result Display: the administrator scrolls the wrapped text and resumes at step 2.
* 2c. The administrator chooses Help from the menu or presses F1: PonHub executes the same overview help, preserving the command-box draft, filter and person selection.
* 3a. The help topic is unknown or unavailable: PonHub reports the topic and instructs the administrator to type `help` for available commands.
* 3d. More than one help topic is supplied: PonHub reports `Invalid command format!` followed by the help usage. No topic is executed.
* 3b. Required parameters are missing or invalid: PonHub shows guidance and an example without changing data. The administrator may correct and resubmit at step 3.
* 3c. The administrator uses a planned shortcut, completion, or alternative help form: PonHub maps it to the corresponding command and resumes at step 3.
* 4a. The chosen command fails for a domain-specific reason: PonHub reports the error, changes no data, and the use case ends.

**Postconditions:** The requested guidance remains visible, or the selected command has completed with clear feedback.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on Windows, Linux and macOS using Java `25`. On macOS, use the course-prescribed Azul JDK 25 with JavaFX (`25.0.3.fx-zulu`), as described in [Setting up and getting started](SettingUp.html#setting-up-the-project-on-your-computer).
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1,000 persons, 1,000 recurring lessons, and 10,000 attendance records without noticeable sluggishness during typical usage.
3.  Team performance target: common operations should update the GUI within 2 seconds on a reference machine recorded with its hardware, OS, Java version and test dataset. The reference machine and measured results are still to be documented; this guide does not claim the target has been verified.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code or system administration commands) should be able to accomplish most recurring tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The product should be for a single user and use one local data store, without requiring user accounts, concurrent access, or live synchronisation.
5.  The product should be packaged into a single executable `.jar` file and should not require an installer.
6.  The product file size should remain below 100 MB to ensure efficient storage and distribution.
7.  The GUI should display correctly and without layout issues on screen resolutions of 1920×1080 and higher at 100% and 125% scale.
8.  The GUI should remain usable (i.e. all functions remain accessible even if the layout is suboptimal) at screen resolutions of 1280×720 and higher at 150% scale.
9.  All operational data must be stored locally in a human-readable text file without using a database management system.
10. All successful data changes must be saved automatically and reliably. Failed validation or saving must leave both the in-memory data and stored data file unchanged.
11. All person, lesson, and attendance data must remain on the user's computer and must never be transmitted over the internet.
12. The application should function offline without requiring an internet connection or a team-owned remote server.
13. Invalid inputs must not crash the application or modify existing data. The application should display a specific error message explaining how the user can correct the input.
14. The application should be implemented primarily using object-oriented programming, with clear separation between the UI, Logic, Model, and Storage components.
15. Team testing target: the JUnit-based automated test suite should achieve at least 70% line coverage, and all automated tests should pass before a release. The percentage is the team's own goal, not a course-mandated minimum; coverage does not replace behavior-focused regression and integration checks.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, or macOS
* **AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)**: The upstream SE-EDU desktop application that is incrementally evolved into PonHub
* **Person record**: A stored record representing one student, tutor, or parent and containing the fields required for that role
* **Role**: The `student`, `tutor`, or `parent` category assigned to a person record, which determines its required fields and applicable operations
* **Shared recurring lesson**: An independent weekly teaching slot with a stable Lesson ID, day, start/end time, subject, tutor and room; its roster may contain zero or more Student IDs
* **Lesson occurrence**: One dated instance of a recurring lesson
* **Attendance record**: A stored record containing the attendance status of one student for one lesson occurrence
* **Attendance status**: The recorded state of a student for a lesson occurrence, such as `present` or `absent`
* **Attendance key**: The combination of student, lesson, and date that uniquely identifies one attendance record
* **Exact duplicate person**: A person record with the same role, normalised name, and identifying contact number as an existing record
* **Displayed person index**: The positive one-based position in the current filtered people list used to select a person in a command; it is distinct from a stable ID and may change when that people view is filtered or reordered. Lesson, roster and history row positions do not supply person command indices
* **Stable person ID**: The role-prefixed identity stored for a person and used in internal lookup, queries, relationships and persistence; commands resolve a displayed person index once to this identity
* **Stable lesson ID**: The `L`-prefixed identity of a shared Lesson, persisted and used in attendance references; existing lessons are selected in commands with `lid/LESSON_ID`, never a per-student lesson index
* **Tutor lookup**: Lesson creation resolves a normalized full tutor name and optional exact phone to one Tutor ID; search uses partial tutor-name text instead
* **Prefix**: A short marker in a command that identifies the type of information represented by the following value
* **Parser**: The Logic component that converts raw command text into validated parameters and a command object
* **Command**: An executable request representing one user operation in PonHub
* **Referential integrity**: The rule that prevents a record from being removed while another lesson or attendance record still refers to it
* **Atomic update**: An all-or-nothing change where either the complete operation is saved successfully or none of it is applied
* **Rollback**: The restoration of the previous valid state after an operation cannot be completed or saved
* **Human-readable data file**: The local text file used to store PonHub data in a form that can be inspected and edited without a database management system
* **Tutor clash**: An overlap between lessons assigned to the same tutor on the same day and during an overlapping time range
* **Room clash**: An overlap between lessons assigned to the same room on the same day and during an overlapping time range
* **Class**: A tuition-centre term for a shared recurring lesson; core membership uses the Lesson-owned roster, with capacity and one-off reservations deferred
* **Enrolment**: A Student's current membership in a shared Lesson; removing membership retains dated attendance
* **Roster**: The current enrolled Student IDs owned by one shared Lesson, from which displayed student records are derived
* **History**: Retained dated attendance keyed by Student ID, Lesson ID and date, independent of current membership
* **Capacity (future)**: A later limit on the number of students in a class
* **Make-up booking (future)**: A one-off reservation in a suitable class for a student who missed a regular lesson, without changing regular membership
* **Waiting list (future)**: An ordered queue of students requesting a place in a class that has reached a later capacity limit
* **Class-swap request (future)**: A pending request to move a student when a transfer cannot be completed immediately
* **Archived student (future)**: A withdrawn student retained for historical reference but hidden from the default active-student list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Use Java 25 and the [runtime prerequisites](SettingUp.html#setting-up-the-project-on-your-computer) for these checks. On macOS, use the course-prescribed Azul JDK 25 with JavaFX (`25.0.3.fx-zulu`) for the Mac's architecture. Confirm the terminal used for `java -jar` selects that installation and record the OS, architecture and JDK distribution/version with the test results. Additional macOS trials with other distributions, including plain Oracle JDK, are optional portability checks.

### Inline help and supported routes

1. Launch the built JAR using Java 25 in a fresh folder. Run `help`, then `help add`, `help delete`, `help list`, `help help`, and `help exit`. Each topic must match its actual active parser and supply a runnable example. Requesting `help exit` must leave the application open.
2. Select a person card, type an unfinished command, and choose Help from the menu. Repeat with F1 while focus is in the command box and in Result Display. Expect identical overview guidance, no separate window, unchanged card selection and unchanged unfinished input.
3. Run `help ADD`; expect the same content as `help add`. Run `help remove`, `help clear`, and `help addlesson`; expect an unknown-topic message directing you to `help`. Run `help add delete`; expect the help usage after `Invalid command format!`.
4. Resize to the minimum width. Run `help add`, scroll to its last example and back to the top. Expect wrapped, readable text and a working vertical scrollbar. Request another topic while scrolled down; it starts at the beginning.
5. Run `edit 1 n/Alex`, `clear`, and `find Alex`. Expect `Unknown command.` and unchanged people/data. Run `list extra` and `exit extra`; expect their usage messages and no list change or exit.
6. Compare the operational file before and after help; it must be byte-for-byte unchanged, and a missing operational file must remain missing. The automated failing-storage test covers help without operational write access. Preference saving at application shutdown remains separate.

Repeat the topic/example checks whenever a feature owner registers another command. Broader shared-lesson workflow and published-site checks remain pending the owners' integration; passing help checks alone does not establish completion of the broader team target. That complete target is separate from the Week 8 first-increment requirement.

### Planned person-index integration checks

Run these application checks only after the corresponding canonical routes activate; follow the
[shared selector contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract).

1. On a mixed-role dataset, run `list`, `list r/student`, `list r/TUTOR` and `list r/parent`.
   Verify global relative order and counts; repeat with no matching records for a successful empty role.
   Reject `list r/`, `list r/all`
   and `list r/student r/parent` without changing the previous view or data.
2. Filter to Students whose stable IDs differ from positions, such as `S2`/`S5` at `1`/`2`.
   `delete 1` targets the first card subject to relationship guards. Reject `delete S2`, zero,
   negative and out-of-range indices; Student-only commands reject a Tutor/Parent at a valid position.
3. Display lesson/roster/history results, then use a people selector. Verify the same people card is
   selected and its filter/order is preserved. Exercise `lessons si/1` against the current Student card;
   reject wrong-role/range and superseded `sid/S2` input. Existing lesson references use `lid/`.
4. Add a person successfully: expect new record last, all-role view and refreshed positions. Trigger
   validation/save failure: expect unchanged records, allocation counters and previous people view,
   including its role filter and selected card.
   Restart with compatible data: surviving stable IDs and stored references remain intact.

### Planned people-card display checks

The prepared cards are dormant. Repeat these checks in the activated application; isolated preview
instructions are preserved in [#77](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/77).

1. Use all roles, absent/present optional contacts, leading-zero phones and long names/email/addresses.
   Verify index and stable ID are separate, role-required fields remain readable, and absent contacts
   show `Not provided`.
2. On 1280×720 at 150% and 1920×1080 at 100%/125%, resize and scroll through an entire tall card to the
   last record. Complete values must wrap without overlap or hidden content; record the actual platform,
   scaling and build. Logical preview sizes alone do not establish these results.
3. Filter/refresh the list and repeat: current positions, count and empty placeholder update correctly;
   recycled cells show the correct person. Coordinate whole-window checks with
   [#128](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/128).

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the JAR file and copy it into an empty folder.

   1. Double-click the JAR file.<br>
      Expected: The GUI opens with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimal.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimal size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Relaunch the app by double-clicking the JAR file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location are retained.

### Contact validation in the current increment

Use inherited contact commands in a disposable data folder; role-aware add remains dormant.

1. Enter `add n/  Anne-Marie   O'Neil  p/00123456 e/anne%school@example.com a/  Blk 10,   #01-02  `.
   Expect normalized name `Anne-Marie O'Neil` and address `Blk 10, #01-02`, retaining punctuation,
   email and phone zeros. Restart: the saved values remain intact.
2. Try `add n/Test User p/1234567890123456 e/test@example.com a/Blk 10`, then
   `add n/Test User p/123 e/test@localhost a/Blk 10`. Expect the relevant phone/email constraints
   and no addition. Likewise reject `n/Test2 User` and `a/Blk 10/Unit 2` in otherwise valid input.
3. Paste an email consisting of 5,000 `a.` repetitions followed by `a@example.com` into otherwise valid
   add input. Expect email constraints without a crash or saved contact.
4. In separate copies of a valid file, introduce an invalid contact above or names `Alex  Tan`/`Alex Tan`
   that become duplicate after normalization. Expect protected startup and original bytes preserved
   through help/list/exit, attempted mutations and restart. Use the [Storage recovery procedure](#current-protected-startup)
   for a deliberately corrected compatible working copy; broader canonical loading remains planned.

### Deleting a person

These checks apply to inherited contacts; canonical deletion also needs the planned selector and relationship checks.

1. Run `list` with several contacts, then `delete 1`. Expect the first visible contact to disappear and
   feedback to identify it.
2. Try `delete`, `delete 0`, `delete -1`, `delete x` and an index beyond the list size. Expect useful
   format/range feedback with no deletion or list change.

### Planned shared-lesson workflow checks

Run these as the corresponding routes become available, using an isolated supported dataset. They verify the broader target rather than adding a complete-workflow requirement to every Week 8 PR.

1. Add one Tutor and two Students, read the assigned IDs, and create one lesson with `addlesson d/Mon st/1600 et/1730 s/Math tu/FULL_NAME tp/EXACT_PHONE rm/R1`, replacing the tutor placeholders with the added tutor's values. The catalogue must show the new lesson once with an empty roster. Substitute the actual returned Lesson ID for `L1` in every later `lid/` argument.
2. Run `list r/student`, check both current positions and use them in `enrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1`. Both students must refer to the same Lesson ID; the tutor and room booking must still exist only once. Check student clashes separately from global tutor/room clashes, including adjacent times.
3. Keep that people view while running `lessons`, `lessons si/STUDENT_INDEX` and `showlesson lid/L1`. Verify the people filter/order/indices remain unchanged. A roster position must not be reinterpreted as a people-list selector.
4. For each student, mark Monday `2026-10-05` with `mark STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1 d/2026-10-05 s/present` or `s/absent`. Verify one record per student/lesson/date, same-status no-op, correction and explicit unrecorded display for another Monday without a mark.
5. Unenrol one student using `unenrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1`. `history STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1` must retain their record. Correction and `unmark STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1 d/2026-10-05` must work for that existing key; a new mark without membership must be rejected. Check Student and Lesson deletion guards before and after removing their remaining dependencies.
6. Exercise each activated search filter from the full matrix, including a parent with two linked children and a student with two differently scheduled lessons. Combined filters must not take the name from one child and the lesson from another, or the day from one lesson and the subject from another. Verify distinct-ID counts, successful empty results and empty-lesson discovery when appropriate.
7. Restart and verify IDs, global creation order, membership and retained attendance. Trigger a save failure in an isolated test seam and verify the aggregate, allocation state and active views are restored. Read-only list/query/history/help operations must not rewrite operational data in the integrated runtime. Record the actual build, platform and results; do not treat unperformed checks as passes.

### Planned canonical loading and recovery

These checks apply when canonical-format loading is activated. The current inherited runtime already protects rejected files, while canonical loading and initialization remain planned. Use copies in disposable test folders and keep the preserved original and backup outside all configured operational paths.

1. In a deliberately separate empty folder, launch the canonical build with no operational file. Expect a valid fresh supported root. Add delivered records and restart; expect successful restoration. This does not authorize replacing a legacy or rejected file in an existing folder.
2. Close the app and make a valid manual edit to supported versioned JSON using its delivered schema, such as correcting a contact value while preserving valid IDs, allocation state and references. Restart; expect the edited records to load. Repeat with valid memberships and dated history. Human editing must remain usable.
3. In independent copies, test malformed JSON, a null root/record, wrong record shapes, duplicate IDs or normalized duplicate people, dangling references, impossible dates, invalid allocation state, unreadable files and unsupported versions. Even a future-version file resembling legacy `persons` must be rejected before domain decoding or any write. Expect a controlled diagnostic and recovery instructions rather than a crash.
4. Capture each rejected file's bytes, then attempt help/list/exit and a data mutation wherever the failure state permits them. The rejected operational bytes must remain identical, and mutations must be blocked. If startup exits safely instead, verify it reports the reason and performs no operational write. Preferences are checked separately.
5. Test an unversioned AB3 file and formerly accepted contacts rejected by #61. Expect no guessed roles, silent conversion, record dropping or empty writable fallback. Follow the backup/manual re-entry guidance in a separate empty folder with explicitly chosen roles. Verify only the new supported root is writable and that the old file and preserved backup remain unchanged.
6. Correct an invalid supported file on a working copy while the app is closed, then restart and verify complete validation succeeds. If recovery uses an older build for inspection, use another working copy rather than the preserved original or backup. Record actual outcomes and the implemented error/recovery path in the UG/DG when this feature lands; no importer or recovery command is assumed.
