## **Design**

### Current increment and command integration

`MainApp` connects one canonical session/root to Logic, cards and protected storage. Normal sessions
support role-aware `add`, empty-roster `addlesson`, `enrol`, `unenrol`, `list`, own-contact people `search`,
`help` and `exit`; protected sessions allow only help/list/exit. Guarded deletion, attendance, lesson-result/history
routes and relationship/lesson search remain planned. Inherited edit/clear/find routes are unavailable.
Stored attendance is supported without activating mark/unmark/history commands.

`CanonicalCommandCatalog` defines available command words and guidance; `CanonicalPeopleSession`
routes commands through `execute()`. Register or withdraw a route with matching parser/usage,
catalogue and routing tests, and UG/manual checks, using this same root/view and compatible persistence.
Inherited AB3 classes remain regression seams; they do not form a second active people store.
See [startup](#canonical-application-startup-85), [Storage](#storage-component) and the
[UG](UserGuide.html#current-command-summary) for loading, transactions and supported syntax.

### Canonical application startup (#85)

`MainApp` selects `data/ponhub.json` by default or the launch argument `--data=PATH`, then constructs one
`CanonicalPeopleSession` and its `CanonicalLogicManager`. Packaged application home is the folder containing the JAR, independently of the terminal working
directory; development launches fall back to the working directory. Relative `--data` paths resolve from
that home; absolute paths are allowed only inside it. Blank paths, `..` escapes and symbolic-link escapes
are rejected before operational/preferences access. Data, preferences and the root reserved
`addressbook.log*` files must remain separate, including symbolic/hard-link aliases. File logging starts
only after this preflight; symbolic log files retain console-only logging. Quote a path containing spaces, for example
`java -jar ponhub.jar --data="separate store/ponhub.json"`. The status footer shows the selected operational
path. Preferences use `home/preferences.json` and logs stay in that same application home; an old
preference's legacy address-book path does not select canonical operational data.

The selected file is classified and validated once. Confirmed absence supplies an unwritten empty root,
without sample records; only a successful addition creates operational data. Valid supported input installs
one complete snapshot. Rejection preserves the file and opens a visibly protected empty view with actionable
path-specific recovery guidance. Only help/list/exit remain available, and external repair or removal does not
unlock that session before restart. Default startup leaves `data/addressbook.json` untouched; legacy AB3 data
selected explicitly is preserved and rejected, with backup and manual re-entry into a separate missing store.
No migration, setup or recovery command is introduced.

### Window placement and active contact-card layout

At startup, `WindowPlacement` fits saved window dimensions and coordinates to the current screen work areas. It chooses the screen with the largest overlap with the saved window, preserves valid coordinates on secondary screens, and centers a new or wholly offscreen window on the primary screen. Invalid saved dimensions fall back to the defaults. JavaFX's visual bounds already use logical coordinates and exclude desktop bars; they are not divided by the display scale again. The startup fit does not impose a permanent maximum size, so the administrator can move and resize the window on a larger monitor.

The main window has a 450-by-360 logical minimum where the work area allows it. The result area can shrink while retaining its own scrollable text, and the people list retains a visible scrollable viewport. Active canonical person cards fit their list cells and wrap names, role details and contact values. The inherited contact-card wrapping and tag regressions remain isolated compatibility checks; canonical records have no tag field. `addlesson`, `enrol` and `unenrol` are active through the command box; lesson-result routes remain unavailable.

### Shared-lesson target contract

The agreed design ([#60](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/60)) uses one canonical
root for ordered people, independent shared lessons and dated attendance. This contract describes
the target; the [runtime summary](#current-increment-and-command-integration) identifies active routes.

| Record or relationship | Authoritative representation |
| --- | --- |
| People | Immutable `Student`, `Tutor` and `Parent` implement `PersonRecord`. Student composes contact details, level and parent phone; it neither extends legacy `Person` nor owns lessons. |
| Shared lessons | Each Lesson has a stable Lesson ID, Tutor ID, weekday/time, subject, room and `enrolledStudentIds`. Its roster owns membership; empty lessons remain valid. |
| Derived views | Student lessons, rosters and tutor schedules resolve IDs from that root. They never form another writable membership graph or duplicate a shared lesson. |
| Attendance | Student ID + Lesson ID + date identifies one `present` or `absent` record. No entry means unrecorded; history survives unenrolment. |
| Parent links | Optional Parent records link by exact equality of their phone and a Student's parent phone, preserving leading zeros. A matching Parent record is not required. |

**Selectors and identity.** `INDEX`/`STUDENT_INDEX` is a positive one-based position in the current
filtered **people list**. Check range and required role, then resolve once to stable `PersonId` for
the whole operation. Filtering renumbers positions without changing stored IDs (`S1`, `T1`, `P1`);
cards distinguish both. Lesson, roster and history results preserve the people filter/order/indices;
their row positions are never person selectors. Existing lessons use stable `lid/LESSON_ID` (`lid/L1`).
`lessons [si/STUDENT_INDEX]` resolves its optional Student selector by the same rule. Stored
relationships and internal query APIs use stable IDs, never displayed positions.

**Tutor lookup.** `addlesson` matches `tu/TUTOR_NAME` by normalized full name, ignoring case and
repeated spaces. If supplied, `tp/TUTOR_PHONE` must also match exactly; never ignore it. Reject zero
matches or ambiguity without mutation, requesting a phone to disambiguate. Search `tu/` instead
matches a case-insensitive name fragment; Tutor-category name search uses `n/`.

The [UG command formats](UserGuide.html#planned-command-summary) and [search matrix](#supported-criteria)
define the complete planned syntax and filters. A delivered search slice advertises only available
filters while retaining the remaining target. Documentation alone does not activate a route.

**Scheduling and history.** Create each lesson once with an empty roster. Reject tutor/room clashes
between distinct same-weekday lessons, and a student's clashes with other enrolled lessons. Joining
the same lesson does not book its tutor/room again. Times are half-open `[start, end)`: adjacent
`1600–1700`/`1700–1800` slots and equal times on different weekdays are allowed.

Unenrolment removes membership only. New attendance needs current membership and a real date on the
lesson's weekday; an existing historical key can be corrected or unmarked after unenrolment.
Repeating a status is a no-op. Unmark removes that dated key, never membership.

**Deletion guards.** Reject blocked deletion without changes or cascading:

| Record | Guard or retained data |
| --- | --- |
| Student | Block while any roster or attendance record references its ID. |
| Tutor | Block while any Lesson references its ID. |
| Lesson | Block while its roster is nonempty or attendance references its ID. |
| Parent | Preserve Students' parent-phone values; only derived links disappear. |

Complete independent snapshots include relationships and monotonic allocation state; deleted
committed IDs are never reused. [Storage](#storage-component) is authoritative for versioned schema,
validation, protected loading, recovery and save-before-publication transactions. Preferences have
a separate lifecycle. Extended features are listed in [Requirements](#user-stories); undo/archiving
constraints are described [below](#future-undoredo-and-archiving).

Ownership and implementation coordination remain in [AboutUs](AboutUs.html#project-team) and
[tracker #59](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/59).

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

`Main` launches JavaFX; [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)
checks application paths, constructs the canonical session and separate preferences, then connects
`CanonicalLogicManager` and UI. It saves preferences separately at shutdown.

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [UI](#ui-component) | Render observable views, accept commands and show feedback. |
| [Logic](#logic-component) | Parse/dispatch commands and coordinate execution, persistence and publication. |
| [Model](#model-component) | Own canonical records, invariants and derived views; keep preferences separate. |
| [Storage](#storage-component) | Validate/load local files and persist complete operational snapshots safely. |
| [Commons](#common-classes) | Supply shared value helpers, exceptions, logging and settings. |

Components depend on interfaces rather than manager implementations, keeping UI, command and file
handling independently testable:

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The inherited diagrams record historical manager types and the broad `delete 1` flow; active deletion
is unavailable. Canonical additions save staged state before publication; failure leaves the live
state unchanged. See [Command transactions](#command-transactions) for that boundary.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The JavaFX `MainWindow` composes `UiPart` controls such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `PersonRecordListPanel`; their
layouts live in `src/main/resources/view`. UI sends commands through `Logic` and observes model-backed results so
committed changes refresh the display. The diagram describes the inherited `Person` UI rather than the active card type.

The active canonical cards display immutable `PersonRecord` projections from the session's same observable people
list, with separate current-view positions and stable IDs and wrapping labels for required and optional fields.
Lesson, roster and history result views remain planned; see the [shared selector and view contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract)
for how those results must preserve the people list.

### Logic component

**API:** [`Logic`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java).

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

`CanonicalLogicManager` delegates to the single `CanonicalPeopleSession`. The session's `execute()`
dispatches commands through its switch, using `CanonicalCommandCatalog` for available command words
and guidance. It parses add/addlesson/enrol/unenrol/list/search input and invokes `CanonicalCommandExecutor`, which
saves a changed candidate before publishing its root and view and returning `CommandResult`.
Parse, domain or save failure preserves
live records, allocation counters, filter and selection. Read-only commands/no-ops skip operational
saving. List clears search criteria and optionally sets a role; search replaces the people filter,
while lesson creation and membership changes preserve it. See [Storage](#command-transactions).

The class/parser diagrams describe retained legacy regression seams, not active application wiring.

![Interactions inside Logic for inherited deletion](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The inherited deletion diagram focuses on parsing and command execution. Its per-call parser
construction predates the registered catalogue, and it omits the current transaction boundary;
the active boundary is described above. Legacy parser subclasses share the `Parser` interface:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

Canonical commands follow the [shared selector contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract) and execute
through the same session/executor when integrated; documented foundations do not activate routes.

#### Read-only retrieval API contract (#113)

[`Logic`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)
declares the UI-facing retrieval methods; [`LessonQuerySource`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/query/LessonQuerySource.java)
and [`LessonQueries`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/query/LessonQueries.java)
define the lesson backend supplied by the active `CanonicalPeopleSession`. Its canonical Model owns projections
from one `PonHubData` root; `CanonicalLogicManager` delegates to that same source. Catalogue and filtered
results contain each lesson once in creation order, including empty lessons. Student lessons derive from current
Lesson-owned membership; rosters use people creation order, and tutor schedules use weekday, start time and numeric
lesson ID. Lookup by lesson ID reads the full catalogue regardless of its active filter.

[`LessonView`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/query/LessonView.java)
and [`StudentView`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/query/StudentView.java)
expose current display fields without becoming stored records. Planned
[`AttendanceHistoryEntry`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/query/AttendanceHistoryEntry.java)
also distinguishes recorded present/absent status from current enrolment; history comes from dated attendance and
survives unenrolment. A missing entry means unrecorded. See the [shared contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract) for
command indices versus stable IDs and for preservation of the people view.

Queries never save data or allocate IDs. Lists are unmodifiable observable views: a UI-held list remains the same
object while committed changes and rollback refresh its entries. Existing records with no matches yield valid empty
lists, while an unknown lesson lookup yields an empty `Optional`. Lesson queries reject null IDs and unknown or
wrong-role IDs for list retrieval; exact signatures and exceptions are in the linked source/Javadoc.

**Integration status:** #80's lesson/roster backend is connected to the active canonical session and exposed by
`CanonicalLogicManager`; the retained legacy `ModelManager` still reports retrieval unavailable. Attendance-history
methods await #100. Lesson commands and separate result views remain pending; search enters through
`Logic.execute(String)` and follows the [planned search matrix](#supported-criteria) when its routes activate.

### Model component

**Legacy API:** [`Model`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java).

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The inherited diagram records `AddressBook`, `UniquePersonList` and `ModelManager`, retained for
regression tests. Active `PonHubData` instead owns immutable canonical records and relationships;
`PeopleView` derives one observable role-filtered projection from that root. UI observes committed
projections rather than maintaining writable copies. Preferences remain outside operational snapshots.

The aggregate below implements the [shared ownership and identity contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract).
Complete independent transaction snapshots preserve records, relationships and allocation state.

#### Canonical data aggregate (#76)

`PonHubData` holds one immutable `PonHubDataState`: ordered people and their per-role allocation
history, shared lessons and their rosters, dated attendance, and the last allocated lesson sequence.
`exportState()` returns a stable snapshot; copy construction and `resetData(...)` safely share immutable
state. Replacing one container's state cannot change any previous snapshot or another container.

Snapshot construction copies incoming lists and rejects duplicate IDs/attendance keys, missing or
wrong-role references, and lesson IDs beyond the supplied counter. Historical attendance does not
require current enrolment. Equality includes records, collection order, rosters and allocation history,
including deleted IDs. Zero means no allocation; `Long.MAX_VALUE` means exhaustion, matching the people
registry convention. Counters are preserved as supplied, never reconstructed from retained records.

Read methods expose immutable collections and stable-ID/key lookups. The controlled replacement boundary
accepts only a validated state; invalid construction or null replacement leaves the current state intact.
Feature owners must preserve committed allocation history when preparing normal changes. Restore may
reinstate earlier counters for rollback. Lesson allocation and global tutor/room/student scheduling are supplied by
the #78 API below. Enrolment is activated by #88; deletion and attendance-editing policies remain separate work.

This aggregate leaves `ModelManager`, commands and JSON storage unchanged. Vincent owns snapshot/storage
contracts; Zhu/Yang will prepare validated changes through one future Model adapter, and Ben can consume
the read-only queries. UI filters, selection and preferences remain outside the operational snapshot.
`stateProperty()` exposes a read-only notification boundary for a complete validated snapshot. Staged transaction
containers publish independently; a failed command/save does not change the live root or its subscribed results.

#### Shared lesson scheduling model APIs (#78)

`PonHubData.addLesson(tutorId, timeSlot, subject, room)` is the controlled lesson-creation seam. It resolves the
stable ID against the aggregate's people snapshot and requires an existing Tutor. It derives the next positive
`LessonId` from `lastAllocatedLessonSequence`, creates one empty-roster `Lesson`, builds a complete candidate
`PonHubDataState`, and installs that state only after validation succeeds. Deleted committed IDs are therefore
not reused. Exhaustion at `Long.MAX_VALUE`, a missing/wrong-role Tutor, or any scheduling conflict leaves the
catalogue and counter unchanged.

Every complete `PonHubDataState`, including a restored or deserialized candidate, enforces the same global
schedule invariant. Two lessons whose half-open slots overlap on the same weekday are rejected when either
their stable Tutor IDs match or their normalized `Room` values match. Empty lessons participate in this check.
Adjacent intervals, different weekdays, and simultaneous lessons with both different Tutors and different rooms
are allowed. Tutor names are deliberately irrelevant to clashes; room equality uses `Room`'s locale-independent
upper-case normalization.

The aggregate exposes immutable relationship snapshots for retrieval and deletion integration:

| API | Contract and owner use |
| --- | --- |
| `getLessons()` / `getLesson(LessonId)` | Canonical catalogue order and stable-ID lookup, including empty lessons. |
| `getLessonRoster(LessonId)` | Current Students resolved from Lesson-owned IDs in global people creation order. |
| `getStudentLessons(PersonId)` | Current lessons derived from roster IDs in catalogue creation order. |
| `getAttendanceForStudent(PersonId)` / `getAttendanceForLesson(LessonId)` | Retained attendance references in aggregate storage order; neither depends on current enrolment. |
| `isPersonReferenced(PersonRecord)` | Predicate for Zhu's guarded people deletion: Student roster/attendance and Tutor lesson references block removal; Parent links remain derived. |
| `isLessonReferenced(LessonId)` | Guard for Yang's lesson deletion: a non-empty roster or retained Attendance blocks removal. |

`PonHubData` owns normal lesson allocation and atomic state installation. `PonHubDataState` owns whole-root
identity, reference and scheduling validation. `Lesson` remains the immutable record and sole owner of roster
membership. Ben may build projections only from the read APIs; they never mutate records or counters. Vincent's
serialization must preserve the supplied catalogue order and lesson allocation counter, construct the entire
candidate snapshot before replacement, and use its validation rather than installing partial arrays.

#### Shared lesson creation command (#86)

`AddLessonParser` converts the seven lowercase fields into a `LessonCreationInput` without reading operational
state or allocating an ID. It rejects preambles, control characters, unknown/repeated/missing/blank prefixes and
delegates day, time, subject, tutor-name, phone and room validation to the existing value objects. `tp/` is optional;
when present, its `Phone` retains leading zeros.

`CanonicalAddLessonCommand` resolves Tutors only from the staged aggregate. It compares `tu/` with the normalized
full name, ignoring case and repeated spaces. Zero name matches fail. Multiple name matches require `tp/`; whenever
`tp/` is supplied, it must exactly match the selected Tutor even if the name alone is unique. No fallback to a
name-only result occurs after a phone mismatch.

After resolving one stable Tutor ID, the command calls `PonHubData.addLesson(...)` on the transaction's staged root.
That existing aggregate boundary allocates the next uncommitted Lesson ID, validates the complete tutor/room
schedule, and creates an empty roster. `CanonicalCommandExecutor` then saves the complete people/lesson snapshot
before publishing it. Parse, tutor-selection, clash, allocation and save failures discard the transaction, preserving
the live catalogue, allocation counter, people filter and subscribed lesson-query lists. Success reports the new
stable Lesson ID and the saved lesson is immediately available through the lifetime `LessonQueries` component.

#### Indexed lesson query projections (#80)

`model.query.LessonQueries` implements `LessonQuerySource` over one supplied canonical root. Its immutable
`LessonViewData` and `StudentViewData` entries resolve current Tutor/Student information by stable ID. Lessons alone
own membership; attendance never supplies a roster or enrolment. Shared lessons appear once, including empty ones.
The active session owns this component for its lifetime; `CanonicalLogicManager` delegates its six lesson
retrieval methods without saving data or changing the people filter. The retained legacy adapter has no
canonical query source. Lesson commands and separate result views still require their compatible slices.

`LessonsArgumentsParser` now prepares `lessons [si/STUDENT_INDEX]` as an optional current people-list `Index`.
`LessonRetrieval` resolves that index once through the shared `PeopleView`, checks the Student role, and passes its
stable ID to `LessonQueries`. It also applies `c/lesson` criteria to the separate filtered lesson result list. Both
methods return the query layer's read-only observable results without changing the people view or operational data.
These classes do not register either command or render cards; #90 activation still follows lesson creation,
enrolment and the coordinated runtime cutover.

| Query API | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| `findLessonById(id)` | Hash lookup in the complete catalogue, independent of the active filter. |
| `getLessonList()` | Stable, unmodifiable observable catalogue in source creation order. |
| `getStudentLessons(id)` | Reverse index derived from Lesson-owned roster IDs, in catalogue order. |
| `getLessonRoster(id)` | Current Student projections in global people creation order. |
| `getTutorSchedule(id)` | Assigned lessons by Monday-first weekday, start time, then numeric Lesson ID. |
| `getFilteredLessonList()` | Separate observable lesson results; leaves person positions unchanged. |
| `searchLessons(criteria)` | Immutable result snapshot; does not change the active filter or stored data. |
| `getLessonFilter()` / `setLessonFilter(criteria)` | Model view state only; a category-only lesson filter restores all results. Invalid criteria preserve the previous filter/results. |

Construction builds people/lesson ID maps, Student-to-Lesson and Tutor-to-Lesson indexes, ordered roster projections,
and exact weekday/start/end buckets. A search selects the smallest supplied exact-value bucket, then applies every
criterion to each candidate Lesson. `s/`, `tu/`, `rm/` and `sn/` retain case-insensitive substring matching, including
short fragments; `tu/` searches tutor names. `sn/` examines the same lesson's current roster and excludes empty
rosters. Matching two students still emits one Lesson. There is no cross-lesson combination of day, subject, room,
tutor or student conditions. All seven lesson prefixes follow the existing [criteria matrix](#supported-criteria).
The parser rejects unsupported, incompatible, blank, repeated and malformed values before query execution.
An empty search result is valid. People/parent/tutor relationship traversal remains in its separate integration slices.

All derived indexes rebuild on `PonHubData.stateProperty()` publication, after successful save/commit or restore,
never per query. Already returned observable lists retain object identity while their entries refresh. This covers
lesson addition/deletion, current membership edits, person detail edits, attendance changes and rollback. If a
subscribed record is removed, its held list becomes empty; a new list query for that missing ID is rejected. Restoring
the record repopulates the same held list. Previously returned projection objects and `searchLessons` snapshots
remain immutable historical snapshots. All operations run on the single model/JavaFX application thread; UI selection
must follow stable IDs when immutable entries are replaced. The runtime adapter owns one query component for its lifetime.

Each subscription refresh snapshots its existing entries before firing list-change callbacks. A read-only callback
may request another Student, Tutor or roster list; that new list starts from the complete current indexes and stays
subscribed for later publications. It cannot interrupt the current refresh by changing the traversed map.

For `P` people, `L` lessons and `R` roster links, query-index construction is `O(P + L + R + L log L)` in the worst case
(the final term sorts tutor schedules). Derived storage is `O(P + L + R + C)`, where `C` counts subscribed IDs,
including removed records whose held lists must survive restore. Stable-ID lookup and returning an already
subscribed list take expected `O(1)`; first subscription
copies its `K` entries in `O(K)`. A search checks `B` candidates from the smallest exact bucket, plus their roster
links when `sn/` is supplied: `O(B + R_B + K)` for bounded field lengths and `K` returned results. Without an exact
filter, `B = L`; text-only substring searches still scan the catalogue. Reading/rendering `K` results costs `O(K)`.
These bounds describe queries, excluding the existing whole-snapshot validation and persistence work on mutations.
A prefix trie would change substring behaviour; there is no constant-time guarantee for arbitrary text searches.
Refreshing subscription snapshots also takes `O(C)` time and temporary space, in addition to copying result entries.

Regression tests compare indexed results with an independent raw-record scan for 7,500 seeded filter combinations,
including membership changes and restore. They cover missing/wrong-role/null IDs, duplicate names, shared/empty
lessons, optional contacts and leading zeros, case/Unicode/text fragments, invalid/repeated prefixes, time boundaries,
same-lesson counterexamples, immutable results, held-list refresh, retained attendance and failed-save isolation.
Listener regressions cover adding populated and empty Student/Tutor/roster subscriptions during refresh, absence
of JavaFX callback errors, consistent held roster/filter results and continued updates after subsequent publication.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

Active operational storage uses `ProtectedPonHubDataStorage` around `JsonPonHubDataStorage`; preferences
use `JsonUserPrefsStorage` separately. The inherited class diagram and bullets below describe the retained
legacy storage regression implementation, which is not the application's operational store.

The inherited `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

#### Safe JSON saves

Canonical operational data, retained legacy storage and preferences share a UTF-8 file writer. JSON serialization finishes before writing.
Existing destinations are resolved to their real paths, so saving through a symbolic link updates its
target and preserves the link. Dangling/cyclic links and inaccessible destinations fail before writing.
New files use a resolved parent directory, creating missing directories as needed. Concurrent external
changes to links/files and multiple application instances are not coordinated.

A complete temporary sibling file is written and closed before atomic replacement is attempted.
Only `AtomicMoveNotSupportedException` selects the fallback; permission and other move errors propagate.
The fallback first copies the existing destination into a unique sibling `.ponhub-backup-*.bak` file.
If backup creation/copy fails, replacement is not attempted. After a failed ordinary replacement, the
writer restores the old bytes from that backup (or removes a partial destination for a first save).
If restoration also fails, the complete backup is retained and its path is included in the error;
restore it before continuing or restarting. Never delete such a backup without recovering its contents.

After success, backup cleanup is best effort: a cleanup failure is logged without reporting the committed
save as failed. Other cleanup failures are suppressed on the primary error. Parent directories or
recovery/temporary files can remain after failures or abrupt termination.

The fallback permits saving on filesystems without atomic moves, but is not atomic: concurrent readers
can observe an incomplete destination during replacement/recovery. Its guarantee is a recoverable old
copy, not uninterrupted access at the original path. Neither path promises power-loss durability or
preserves all previous file attributes.

#### Command transactions

The active session invokes `CanonicalCommandExecutor` with its `PeopleView`, protected snapshot writer
and session error supplier. `PeopleView.beginTransaction()` creates an independent working root and view
from the complete live `PonHubDataState` and current role filter. Add validates the full candidate before
saving. The executor compares operational snapshots, saves changed data before publication, then installs
the candidate and returns success. Parse, execution or save failure never refreshes the live list, so records,
allocation history, order, filter and selected card survive failure.

Observable list identity survives successful publication. Read-only commands and unchanged operational
state skip saving; role-filter changes still update the same people view. Help and unchanged views avoid
unnecessary refresh, preserving selection. Protected loading retains its help/list/exit-only restriction.
Preferences retain their separate shutdown lifecycle. Publication performs no new validation or I/O.

Legacy `LogicManager`/`ModelTransaction` remain isolated regression seams; active startup does not use them
as a parallel writable store. Complete-state transactions preserve lesson rosters and retained attendance,
and the persistence codec round-trips those complete snapshots. Attendance records remain independent
of the current roster; never strip history to make a candidate saveable.

#### JSON version detection foundation

`JsonDataVersionDetector.detect(String)` classifies file contents using the existing Jackson dependency,
without constructing Model objects or writing files. The current loader uses this gate before decoding. The supported
PonHub envelope uses `schemaVersion` as a positive JSON integer, initially `1`; this is a data-schema
version, independent of the application version. The canonical codec validates the complete envelope defined in #79 and its lesson and attendance extensions.

| Result | Meaning and later loader action |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| `LEGACY_AB3` | An unversioned object containing a `persons` array and, optionally, the textual `_comment` used by AB3 fixtures. No other root fields are accepted. Contact validity is not checked and roles are never inferred; preserve it for manual upgrade. |
| `PONHUB_V1_CANDIDATE` | Explicit integer `schemaVersion: 1`. Continue to complete envelope/domain validation; this result alone never authorizes loading or saving. |
| `INVALID_VERSION` | An explicit version is null, blank, a string, boolean, collection, fractional number, zero or negative. Reject without coercion. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` | A positive integer other than 1, including values beyond Java integer range. Reject even if `persons` looks like legacy data. |
| `UNRECOGNIZED_FORMAT` | A non-object root or an unversioned object that does not match the legacy root, including extra unknown fields. Reject rather than ignoring fields. |
| `MALFORMED_JSON` | Empty/invalid JSON, duplicate object keys or trailing content after the document. Reject ambiguous input. |

Missing versions identify legacy data only for the strict legacy root shape. A versioned candidate can
still contain missing or invalid records: the detector is a format gate, not a schema/domain validator.
Callers must handle file absence and read errors separately; neither is equivalent to empty JSON.
The active `ProtectedPonHubDataStorage` classifies the selected file before canonical decoding. Legacy AB3
roots are rejected and preserved; version-1 candidates require complete codec validation. Only a confirmed
missing path returns an unwritten empty root. Denied access and dangling final symbolic links are loading
failures. `JsonAddressBookStorage` retains its legacy-only decoder for isolated regression tests.

#### Current protected startup

`ProtectedPonHubDataStorage` records actionable path-specific recovery guidance and locks operational
saves after a controlled selected-file loading failure. `CanonicalPeopleSession` exposes an explicitly
protected empty view; it never treats rejected data as a new writable dataset. The UI shows the warning,
and active routing/help allow only help/list/exit. Listing includes the load diagnostic, so an empty result
cannot be mistaken for saved data. Preferences retain their separate lifecycle. External file repair or
removal does not unlock the session: restart is required.

Malformed JSON, invalid roots/versions/records/counters/references, legacy AB3 and read failures become
controlled rejections. Unrelated programming failures are not swallowed. Supported versioned data loads
after complete codec validation, including attendance dates and references. Missing selected files
start empty and unwritten until successful add, without inherited sample data or automatic legacy migration.

The active canonical [transaction boundary](#command-transactions) also preserves live data and views
after failed commands/saves; read-only commands and operational no-ops skip saving. Protected loading
and preferences remain separate from those normal-session guarantees.

For manual checks, use a disposable selected `data/ponhub.json` or `--data=PATH`, record original bytes,
then test help/list/exit and attempted add in the protected session. Bytes must remain unchanged. Preserve
a backup, close the app, deliberately correct a supported working copy and restart. A legacy original is
kept separately while explicit-role records are re-entered into a previously unused selected path.
Session/storage and application-startup tests cover these boundaries; actual packaged/platform outcomes
must be recorded separately using the procedures below.

#### People-only canonical JSON storage (#79)

`JsonPonHubDataCodec` converts between a complete `PonHubDataState` and the version-1 envelope below.
`JsonPonHubDataStorage` reads one UTF-8 document into a validated candidate and uses the existing safe
file writer for saves. The active session connects them through `ProtectedPonHubDataStorage`; the legacy
address-book path is not used by default. Preferences remain in their existing separate file.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "people": [
    {"id": "S1", "role": "STUDENT", "name": "Alex", "level": "P1", "parentPhone": "00123456"}
  ],
  "personCounters": {"STUDENT": 1, "TUTOR": 0, "PARENT": 0},
  "lastAllocatedLessonSequence": 0,
  "lessons": [],
  "attendance": []
}
```

People array order is global creation order. Roles are `STUDENT`, `TUTOR` or `PARENT` and must agree with
the stable ID prefix. Every record requires `id`, `role` and `name`. Students additionally require `level`
and `parentPhone`; tutors and parents require their own `phone`. Optional `phone` (for students), `email`
and `address` are omitted when absent, never encoded as null. Contact values are strings, preserving
leading zeros. Unknown fields and role-inappropriate fields are rejected rather than silently discarded.

All three person counters and the lesson counter are required nonnegative integers up to `Long.MAX_VALUE`
(exhaustion). They include deleted identities and must not be recomputed from retained records. Person
and lesson counters must cover every retained ID. Lessons, rosters and independent attendance records
are supported. See [Retained attendance persistence](#retained-attendance-persistence-83) for attendance
fields and validation. Serialization finishes before any filesystem write.

Each `lessons` entry stores a shared lesson once; student records do not duplicate its membership:

```json
{
  "id": "L2",
  "tutorId": "T1",
  "day": "Mon",
  "startTime": "0900",
  "endTime": "1000",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "room": "R1",
  "enrolledStudentIds": ["S1", "S2"]
}
```

All lesson fields are required. Times are four-digit strings, days use Mon–Sun, and an empty roster
is valid. The codec rejects unknown fields, wrong types and duplicate roster IDs before constructing
the roster set. After decoding all people and lessons, the immutable aggregate validates unique lesson
IDs, the lesson counter, tutor/student references and overlapping tutor, normalized room or student
bookings. Adjacent half-open time slots are allowed. JSON object-field order and reference position in
arrays do not affect validation; lesson array order is retained. Referenced records must exist in the
complete candidate. Failure returns no partial snapshot and the protected loader retains the original
bytes and blocks writes. Deleted lesson IDs remain reserved through `lastAllocatedLessonSequence`.

Close the app and preserve a backup before manual editing. For example, adding `"email": "alex@example.com"`
to the student above is valid; making a phone numeric, removing a required field, or lowering its student
counter below 1 is rejected. Object field order and whitespace do not matter. Round-trip tests compare the
complete snapshot, including optional-field absence, people order, deleted-ID history and exhausted counters.
Loading classifies the version first and validates all records/counters before returning; callers install
the candidate only on success. Loading itself never writes or changes live state. This codec supplies no
legacy migration or rejected-file session lock; active startup supplies that lock through the protected wrapper.

<a id="planned-protected-loading-and-legacy-upgrade"></a>

#### Protected loading and legacy upgrade

Canonical startup, people commands, cards and the protected loader are now active together. The active runtime classifies the configured file before decoding: missing data may start a fresh supported root; valid supported versioned data loads only after complete domain, identity and reference validation. Unreadable, corrupt, unsupported-version and unversioned AB3 files produce controlled errors, actionable recovery guidance and no operational writes to the rejected file. Preserve its original bytes through help, list, exit and attempted mutations; saving preferences remains separate.

The initial upgrade policy is deliberate backup and manual re-entry into a separate new supported store. An unversioned AB3 contact does not contain enough information to infer a Student, Tutor or Parent role, and a Student additionally needs its level and parent phone. Do not invent those values, discard invalid records, or convert the original in place. Tell the administrator to close the app, preserve a backup of the original data folder, then select a separate previously unused operational path inside the JAR folder with `--data=PATH`, or copy the JAR into a separate empty folder. Re-enter records with explicitly chosen roles and required fields using the active add command. The preserved original and backup are not operational write targets; only the explicitly chosen new supported root is writable. Check the new records before retiring the old working folder. A migration importer and application-level export are future extensions; this policy does not introduce an `import`, `export` or `recover` command.

The contact changes in #61 can reject formerly accepted numeric-only names, long phones or slash-containing addresses, or reveal duplicates after normalization. Diagnose the affected values without overwriting the rejected data. Inspect the local JSON read-only; if the older build is needed to inspect contacts, use an additional working copy, never the preserved original or backup. The administrator supplies any corrections and missing role information. Correctly human-edited supported JSON must load: document the delivered schema, preserve valid stable IDs and allocation state, and validate all relationships without requiring users to avoid editing the file. An invalid edit is rejected as a whole with its bytes preserved. The [manual checks](#planned-canonical-loading-and-recovery) cover this boundary.

### Common classes

`seedu.address.commons` contains shared settings/value helpers, exceptions, JSON/file/string utilities
and `LogsCenter`. Keep reusable infrastructure here; domain invariants belong to Model and command
syntax to Logic. Logging setup and its console fallback are documented in [Logging](Logging.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Lesson scheduling value contracts

The lesson scheduling foundation is represented by immutable value objects in `model.lesson`. These objects validate and
normalize scheduling input before later lesson commands or persistence code use it:

* `LessonId` is a stable identifier consisting of `L` followed by a positive `long` sequence number. Lower-case prefixes
  are normalized, leading zeros are rejected, and advancing beyond `Long.MAX_VALUE` fails explicitly instead of wrapping.
  The canonical aggregate owns allocation state so committed IDs are not reused.
* `LessonDay` accepts the case-insensitive abbreviations `Mon` through `Sun` and stores their canonical display form.
* `LessonTime` accepts exactly four digits in 24-hour `HHMM` format and retains leading zeros when displayed.
* `LessonTimeSlot` combines one weekday with a start and end time. Its end must be strictly later than its start, so
  overnight lessons are rejected. Slots are treated as half-open ranges: `[start, end)`. As a result, adjacent slots do
  not overlap, and equal time ranges on different weekdays do not clash.
* `Subject` contains 1–50 letters, digits or spaces after trimming and reducing repeated spaces to one.
* `Room` contains 1–10 letters or digits. It is normalized to upper case so room comparisons do not miss clashes because
  of letter case.

These value types are used by the active `addlesson` parser. The canonical aggregate supplies lesson creation,
global tutor/room clash checks and ID allocation, and the protected transaction persists the complete change.

#### Shared lesson membership commands (#88)

`LessonMembershipParser` accepts exactly `STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID`, producing an immutable
`LessonMembershipInput` without consulting operational state. `CanonicalEnrolCommand` and
`CanonicalUnenrolCommand` resolve that index once through the current `PeopleView`; wrong-role and out-of-range
selections therefore cannot be reinterpreted through a separate Student list or as a stable-ID suffix.

`PonHubData.enrolStudent` and `unenrolStudent` replace the one canonical `Lesson` at its existing catalogue
position. Enrolment rejects duplicate membership and constructs a complete `PonHubDataState`, which applies the
same Student overlap invariant as loading. Unenrolment requires current membership and changes only the roster;
dated attendance remains in the aggregate. Both operations preserve Lesson/Student identities, lesson allocation
history, and the single tutor/room booking owned by that Lesson.

Commands run through `CanonicalCommandExecutor`: a complete candidate is validated and saved before live state
publication. Successful publication refreshes the existing `LessonQueries` observable list objects and keeps the
people filter/search and ordering. Parse, domain and save failures publish nothing and leave the saved file, root,
people view and subscribed lesson/roster results unchanged.

### Immutable shared lesson records

`Lesson` represents one canonical recurring teaching slot. It stores a stable `LessonId`, one tutor-role `PersonId`,
the validated `LessonTimeSlot`, `Subject` and `Room`, and the set of currently enrolled student-role `PersonId` values.
An empty roster is valid, and several students can refer to the same lesson without duplicating its tutor, room or
schedule. Student records contain no copied `Lesson` values.

The constructor defensively copies the roster and rejects Tutor or Parent IDs in it; the assigned tutor must have a
Tutor ID. `getEnrolledStudentIds()` exposes an unmodifiable snapshot. `withEnrolledStudentIds`,
`withEnrolledStudent`, and `withoutEnrolledStudent` return replacement `Lesson` values, leaving the original lesson
and its stable identity unchanged. Equality, hashing, copying and string representation include every stored field,
including roster membership. The canonical aggregate owns lesson ordering, ID allocation and clash checks; active
membership commands provide duplicate/non-member feedback. Lessons load through the supported codec, the active
`addlesson` route creates an independent empty-roster record, and `enrol`/`unenrol` install replacement values.

### Inline help

`CanonicalCommandCatalog` owns the active command descriptions, usage and runnable examples.
`CanonicalPeopleSession` accepts zero or one help topic, normalizes with `Locale.ROOT`, rejects unknown
topics/excess arguments and restricts guidance to the protected-session routes after rejected loading.
Help preserves records and the people view without operational saves; preferences have a separate
lifecycle. Protected sessions omit `add`, `addlesson`, `enrol`, `unenrol` and `search`; normal sessions expose help
for every active route.
Legacy `CommandCatalog`/`HelpCommandParser` remain regression seams.

The Help menu and F1 both invoke `MainWindow.executeCommand("help")`, retaining the command-box
draft and card selection. `ResultDisplay` is a read-only wrapped TextArea with vertical scrolling;
each new result starts at the top. Focused text-control F1 handling uses that same route. The unused
inherited `HelpWindow` is never constructed by supported entry points.

See [manual help checks](#inline-help-and-supported-routes) for topic, menu/F1 and scrolling behavior.
Guidance follows the [current runtime summary](#current-increment-and-command-integration);
remaining attendance/query foundations do not add help topics.

<a id="person-record-foundation"></a>
<a id="ordered-people-registry-foundation"></a>

### People records and identity

Immutable `Student`, `Tutor` and `Parent` records implement `PersonRecord` and compose `ContactDetails` rather
than extending legacy `Person`. Constructors enforce the record's role and required fields; absent optional
contacts remain absent. Students do not contain copied lessons or attendance. Relationship ownership and
optional parent-record linking follow the [shared contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract).

| Role | Required data | Optional data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student | Student ID, name, education level, parent phone | Own phone, email, address |
| Tutor or parent | Matching role ID, name, own phone | Email, address |

`EducationLevel` accepts `P1`–`P6`, `S1`–`S5`, `JC1` and `JC2`, normalizing to uppercase. `PersonId` is a
role-prefixed positive `long` identity, such as `S1`, with no leading zeros; trimmed constructor input is
case-normalized. It survives contact and view changes. Value equality includes the ID and all stored fields.
Business duplicate matching instead compares **role + normalized name + identifying phone**: parent phone
for a student, own phone for a tutor or parent. Name case and repeated spaces do not distinguish duplicates;
different IDs, optional contacts or student levels cannot bypass this rule. Different-role records are distinct.

<a id="registry-apis"></a>
<a id="allocation-and-state-validation"></a>

[`PeopleRegistry`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/PeopleRegistry.java)
keeps all roles in one global creation order and returns immutable snapshots. Successful additions append a
record and advance only its role's allocation counter; rejected additions change neither. If the last Student
allocation was `S2`, deleting it keeps the counter at `2`, so the next Student receives `S3`. Counters are never reconstructed
from surviving records, even when a role becomes empty. `Long.MAX_VALUE` means exhausted: allocation rejects
before overflow.

`PeopleRegistryState` defensively copies that ordered list and the complete three-role allocation map. It
rejects unsupported record types, duplicate IDs/business keys, missing or negative counters, and counters
below retained ID sequences. Copy/import/export preserve order and deleted/exhausted allocation history;
independent registries share only immutable records. The canonical root uses this state for persistence and
restoration; its actual format is described in [Storage](#people-only-canonical-json-storage-79).

<a id="deletion-and-activation-boundaries"></a>

Registry removal consults the caller's relationship predicate before changing data. Unknown IDs, references
or a failing predicate leave order and counters unchanged. The predicate must query the canonical relationships
without mutating the registry; complete deletion guards follow the shared contract above. This seam does not
activate the guarded deletion command.

### Contact validation and normalization

Shared contact value types validate construction at parser and JSON-loader boundaries, preventing commands
and saved files from admitting different formats.

| Value | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Name | 1–100 characters after trimming/collapsing ASCII spaces; English letters, spaces, apostrophes, hyphens and periods, with at least one letter. Display case is preserved. |
| Phone | 3–15 ASCII digits, stored as text to retain leading zeros. |
| Email | At most 254 characters; local part allows letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `%`, `+`, `-`, without leading/trailing/consecutive periods. Domain has at least two letter/digit/internal-hyphen labels, ending in 2–63 English letters. Spelling/case are preserved. |
| Address | 1–200 printable ASCII characters after trimming/collapsing spaces; `/`, tabs, line breaks and controls are rejected. |

Name/address normalization occurs once in the value type, before equality and hashing; case remains significant
for value equality. Name/address parser boundaries preserve controls for rejection; role-aware add rejects
controls before extraction.
Space normalization scans linearly; email rejects excessive length before a linear, constant-stack format scan,
avoiding stack overflow on hostile repeated input. Phone/email parsing retains surrounding-whitespace trimming.

The active `RoleAwareAddParser` and canonical loader use this policy. Previously accepted files outside it, including
normalization-created duplicates, enter [protected startup](#current-protected-startup); Storage describes
rejected-file preservation and recovery. This contact policy performs no legacy migration. Role-aware
add/list are active as described below.

<a id="role-aware-addition-parsing-foundation"></a>
<a id="staged-person-addition-candidate"></a>
<a id="current-people-index-resolution-foundation"></a>

<a id="prepared-people-commands"></a>

### Canonical people commands

`RoleAwareAddParser` returns immutable, ID-free `PersonAdditionInput`, using the shared contact policy above.
It accepts lowercase prefixes once each in any order; role and education-level values ignore case.

| Role | Required prefixes | Optional prefixes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student | `r/`, `n/`, `l/`, `pp/` | `p/`, `e/`, `a/` |
| Tutor or parent | `r/`, `n/`, `p/` | `e/`, `a/` |

Supplied optional values must be nonblank. Unknown/repeated prefixes, student-only fields on other roles,
preambles, line breaks and controls are rejected. Unicode whitespace is accepted at prefix/value boundaries,
while interior contact characters still follow the shared validators.

[`PersonAdditionCandidate`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/PersonAdditionCandidate.java)
prepares a complete proposed `PonHubDataState` using a temporary registry. It applies duplicate/allocation rules
and appends the new person while preserving lessons, rosters, attendance and lesson allocation history.
Preparation changes no live state or counter; an abandoned candidate reserves no identity. The transaction
must **prepare from a fresh snapshot → save the complete compatible candidate → install**, then report success
and reset the people view to all roles. This helper supplies no save, rollback or UI action.

`CanonicalAddCommand` and `CanonicalListCommand` implement the staged transaction interface merged through
[PR #170](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/pull/170). Addition stages a complete candidate and all-role
view with checked duplicate/exhaustion feedback; the executor saves before publishing and returning stable-ID
success. Listing selects a role and reports its count without operational saves.
`CanonicalPeopleCommandIntegrationTest` exercises the real prepared parser/executor/storage seam, covering
all roles and optional contacts, siblings, canonical duplicates, ID allocation/exhaustion, save/reload and failed-save
restoration. The #85 cutover connects these commands to application startup and cards; manual application/platform checks remain evidence to record, rather than inferred from component tests.

`PersonIndexResolver` applies the [shared selector contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract) to the authoritative
current people list. With students `[S4, S9]`, positions `1` and `2` select those IDs; position `2` never means
`S2`. Resolve once and retain the returned ID throughout the operation. Student-only resolution rejects a
Tutor/Parent at that position without searching another list; range/role failures leave data and view unchanged.

The [#85](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/85) cutover activates these commands through
one session and people panel. Inherited delete is retired until guarded canonical deletion is ready.
Canonical storage supports lessons, rosters and retained attendance. `addlesson`, `enrol` and `unenrol` are active;
deletion, lesson-result, mark, unmark and history routes remain gated.

<a id="prepared-canonical-people-session"></a>

### Canonical people session

`CanonicalPeopleSession` loads the configured path once through `ProtectedPonHubDataStorage` and owns one
private `PonHubData` root. Its `PeopleView`, `CanonicalCommandExecutor` and lifetime `LessonQueries` component
share that root. Callers receive immutable data snapshots and the same unmodifiable observable people list;
the session does not expose writable operational data. Execute on the single model thread, or the JavaFX
application thread once controls are attached.

The session's `execute()` dispatches active `add`, `addlesson`, `enrol`, `unenrol`, `list`, `search`, `help` and
`exit` commands through its switch. `CanonicalCommandCatalog` defines the permitted command words and guidance,
independently
of the retained legacy `CommandCatalog`. The session parses role-aware additions, shared-lesson creation and
membership changes, listings and own-contact searches before staged execution. Changed data is saved through the
protected writer before publication, stable-ID success feedback or person-view changes. Parse, domain and save
failures leave
the original data, allocation counters and complete visible filter/list unchanged.
Read-only commands perform no operational saves.

A confirmed missing file starts an unwritten empty store. A rejected file produces a protected empty view,
with its original bytes preserved and recovery guidance retained. Only `help`, `list` and `exit` are available
in that session; mutation and unknown routes reject before argument parsing. Help advertises the permitted
routes, and list feedback includes the load error so the empty view cannot be mistaken for saved records.
External repair or removal does not unlock that session; recovery requires a new session after deliberate
repair or selection of a separate supported path.

`CanonicalPeopleSessionTest` exercises the real protected loader, router, staged commands and snapshot writer.
Component tests alone do not establish native UI/card or platform acceptance. `MainApp` now constructs
this session and its Logic adapter, and `MainWindow` observes the session's people view. Record actual
packaged save/restart/failure and platform evidence using the procedures below.

<a id="role-filtered-people-listing-foundation"></a>
<a id="prepared-person-record-cards"></a>

<a id="prepared-people-view-and-cards"></a>

### Canonical people view and cards

[`PeopleView`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/PeopleView.java)
derives the people projection from one supplied `PonHubData` root and owns the selected role filter. It retains
one unmodifiable observable
list for both command selection and `PersonRecordListPanel`, preserving global relative order. The people projection's owner explicitly refreshes after committed replacement or rollback, on the JavaFX
application thread when controls are attached. Refresh retains the selected role; parse list arguments before
changing it. A successful addition's reset to all roles belongs to the transaction above.

For detached feedback, `PersonRecordListData` copies an immutable snapshot and supplies numbered entries,
count and an empty message; it does not observe later changes. `PeopleListParser` accepts empty arguments
or one `r/student|tutor|parent` value, with case-insensitive role names, and rejects malformed arguments without
changing any view.

`PersonRecordCardData` separates the numbered name heading from the role/stable-ID line and renders the
required/optional fields in the role table above; absent contacts show `Not provided`. Display case and phone
zeros are retained. `PersonRecordCard` loads wrapping labels from FXML with no fixed card height.
`PersonRecordListPanel` fits cards to cell width, updates positions when cells are reused, and supplies count,
empty placeholder and vertical scrolling for tall cards. Neither projection nor panel owns writable records.

`MainWindow` constructs these canonical cards over the session's current list. Developer preview recipes
and earlier viewport results are preserved in [#77](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/77);
actual application/platform display evidence belongs to [manual testing](#planned-people-card-display-checks).

<a id="prepared-canonical-people-sample-checks"></a>

### Representative canonical people samples

[`PeopleSampleDataUtil`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/PeopleSampleDataUtil.java)
creates a fresh independent registry in deterministic order `T1, S1, P1, S2, T2, S3`, using normal addition rules.
It supports representative acceptance work without duplicating validation or allocation logic.

| Records | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `S1`, `S2`, `P1` | Siblings share parent phone `00987654`, matching Pat Tan's own phone; optional Student contacts are absent/present. |
| `T1`, `T2` | Both tutors are Mei Lim with distinct phones; one omits email/address, exercising future name/phone disambiguation. |
| `S1`, `S3` | Same-name Alex Tan students with different parent phones remain distinct. |

Phone zeros and email case are preserved. These samples are dormant and contain no lessons, enrolments,
attendance or file format. [#101](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/101) preserves the developer
fixture recipes and tracks full-product samples and acceptance after runtime integration.

### Search criteria parsing foundation

[`SearchCriteriaParser`](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/SearchCriteriaParser.java)
parses the arguments
after `search` into immutable `SearchCriteria`. It produces a value object, not a `Command`; routing and help are
connected only when each search slice activates. `SearchField` owns category compatibility and field matching, while
the canonical query layer combines fields against records and relationships. Parsing never writes operational data.

#### Supported criteria

The required category is `c/student`, `c/parent`, `c/tutor` or `c/lesson`, ignoring category-value case. Category-only
input is valid. Prefixes are lowercase, order-independent and unique within a command. The full planned matrix is:

| Prefix | Field | Student | Parent | Tutor | Lesson | Matching |
|--------|-------|---------|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| `n/` | Result person's name | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Partial text |
| `l/` | Student education level | Yes | — | — | — | Exact level |
| `p/` | Result person's own phone | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Exact digits |
| `pp/` | Student's parent phone | Yes | — | — | — | Exact digits |
| `e/` | Email address | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Partial text |
| `a/` | Postal address | Yes | Yes | Yes | — | Partial text |
| `sn/` | Associated student's name | — | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial text |
| `d/` | Lesson weekday | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Exact weekday |
| `st/` | Lesson start time | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Exact HHMM |
| `et/` | Lesson end time | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Exact HHMM |
| `s/` | Lesson subject | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial text |
| `tu/` | Lesson tutor's name | Yes | Yes | — | Yes | Partial text |
| `rm/` | Lesson room | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial text |

Text query values are trimmed, have repeated spaces collapsed, and are case-normalized with `Locale.ROOT`. Filters
use case-insensitive substring matching; fragments need not form a complete valid field value. Thus `n/al` matches
`Sally Tan` and `s/Math` matches `Add Math`. This agrees with canonical name and address normalization.
Lesson creation selects a tutor by normalized **full** name and optional exact phone; search `tu/` matches a tutor
name **fragment**, while tutor-category own-name search uses `n/`.

Phone filters require 3–15 ASCII digits, retain leading zeros and match the complete number. Levels accept only
`P1`–`P6`, `S1`–`S5`, `JC1` and `JC2`, normalized to uppercase. Weekdays accept only `Mon`, `Tue`, `Wed`, `Thu`, `Fri`,
`Sat` and `Sun`, normalized to lowercase. Times require four digits from `0000` to `2359`, with valid minutes.
Start or end may be supplied independently; when both are present, end must be later than start on the same day.

An omitted filter imposes no restriction; a supplied filter never matches an absent optional field. A person with no
relationships still qualifies for own-field-only search. All supplied relational filters must refer to the same
linked student or lesson: a parent cannot take `sn/` from one child and `s/` from another, and a student cannot take
`d/` from one enrolled lesson and `s/` from another. Tutor `sn/` and lesson fields must match one assigned lesson.
Lesson `sn/` checks its current roster, so former members do not match; without `sn/`, empty lessons remain eligible.
Every result is distinct by stable ID and retains canonical order, including a valid zero-result list.

#### Errors and integration boundary

Invalid category, prefix, value, duplicate filter or incompatible time range fails parsing with clear feedback; an
unsupported prefix cannot be absorbed into the preceding text value. The criteria parser validates the entire matrix
but does not traverse relationships. `CanonicalPeopleSession` now routes person search through
`CanonicalSearchCommand`; lesson and relational slices remain staged in #90 and follow-ups.
The command explicitly rejects `c/lesson` and relationship filters rather than ignoring them. The full matrix and conjunction rules remain the target.

`PersonContactSearch` implements the `n/l/p/pp/e/a` own-field slice over immutable canonical person records in their
existing order. Category-only searches include unlinked people; absent optional fields fail supplied filters, and
relationship filters are rejected until their traversal is integrated. The matcher returns an immutable snapshot; it
has no writable state. `PeopleView.setSearchCriteria` validates before replacing the shared observable list and
retains the immutable criteria alongside its role. Refresh uses the complete catalogue and all supplied filters.
`CanonicalTransaction` copies and compares both role and search criteria, so same-role searches publish new results
and later committed mutations preserve the complete filter. `list` and successful `add` clear search criteria;
help and failed commands preserve it. Searches leave snapshot bytes and allocation counters untouched, and report
valid zero-result counts. Protected sessions continue to permit only help/list/exit.

### Dated attendance records

`Attendance` is a separate immutable association record; it is not nested in a Student or Lesson. Its unique
`AttendanceKey` combines one student-role `PersonId`, one `LessonId`, and one `LocalDate`. The remaining stored field
is `AttendanceStatus`, whose only recorded values are `present` and `absent`. A missing key means unrecorded, so no
`unrecorded` status is stored. Current enrolment also remains outside Attendance, allowing dated history to survive
later unenrolment.

External dates are parsed using strict ASCII `YYYY-MM-DD` syntax and calendar validation, including real leap years.
Status parsing is case-insensitive. Wrong-role person IDs, impossible dates and unknown statuses are rejected.
`withStatus` returns a replacement record for the same key and leaves the original unchanged. Equality and hashing
include all three key components and the status, which lets the later canonical aggregate keep one record per key and
replace its value when correcting attendance. This foundation adds no active command, collection or persistence route.

### Future undo/redo and archiving

No undo, redo, archive or restore route is registered. Failed-command rollback is already delivered
through [transactions](#command-transactions); it is separate from user-requested undo. A future
undo/archive design must preserve the [shared reference and identity rules](#shared-lesson-target-contract),
including attendance history and non-reuse of committed IDs. Inherited `VersionedAddressBook`/undo
examples do not describe an implemented PonHub feature.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Tuition centre administrative staff who maintain student, tutor and parent records and coordinate lessons and attendance.

* **Usage context**: During enrolment, timetable planning and daily lesson administration, staff need to find contacts, allocate tutors and rooms, record attendance, and follow up on absences and lesson changes.
* **User characteristics**: Staff understand tuition operations and work repeatedly with names, contact details, student levels and lesson schedules. They need quick record retrieval, clear feedback on invalid changes, and command examples while learning the application.
* **Current problems**: Keeping contact details, schedules and attendance consistent requires repeated checking. Staff need to avoid tutor or room clashes, find the right parent contact promptly, and identify missed lessons that need follow-up.

**Value proposition**: For tuition centre administrative staff who need to keep people, lessons and attendance organised, PonHub provides a single place to manage and search these records, with scheduling checks and attendance tracking to support reliable daily administration.

Compared with maintaining separate contact lists, timetables and attendance records, PonHub connects the information needed for routine tasks and checks conflicting or invalid changes. Planned requirements such as make-up booking extend this support to absence follow-up.

**Shared-lesson MVP target:** Lessons are created independently of student enrolment, including lessons with empty rosters. Each shared `Lesson` owns its currently enrolled student IDs; student lessons, rosters, and tutor schedules are retrieved from that canonical membership rather than copied into each student. Attendance is a separate dated record for one student and one lesson. Unenrolment removes current membership and retains attendance history; an existing historical entry can still be corrected or removed. A missing attendance entry means unrecorded, distinct from present and absent.

**Delivered versus planned:** The [student foundation (#57)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/57), [tutor and parent foundations (#62)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/62), [ordered people registry (#70)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/70), [person-card components (#119)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/119), [role-filtered listing components (#122)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/122), [search criteria foundation (#64)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/64), and [lesson scheduling values (#63)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/63) provide independently tested APIs. The registry, canonical cards and role-filtered listing are now connected to the active people session. [Inline help (#68)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/68) and [safe file replacement (#66)](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/66) are connected to the active canonical people runtime.

Canonical people activation and the remaining shared-lesson integration are tracked in
[#76](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/76),
[#77](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/77),
[#85](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/85), and their dependent command, storage and retrieval
issues. The requirements below describe the intended product; role-aware add/list, empty-roster shared-lesson
creation, enrolment/unenrolment and own-contact people search are active. Guarded deletion, attendance,
lesson-result commands, lesson search, relationship search and history remain planned.

### User stories

These stories describe the broader shared-lesson target and future ideas; they do not imply completed functionality or require every High-priority story to be delivered in Week 8.

Priorities: **High** (core shared-lesson target), **Medium** (future extensions), **Low** (future consideration).
The target includes shared rosters and regular enrolment. Capacity, make-up reservations and waiting lists are future work, as are export, saved searches, archive/restore, richer attendance and percentages, fees and guided workflows. Medium and Low priorities remain proposals for later iterations.

Shared lessons, current membership, and retained dated attendance are separate concepts in these stories. The stories specify user goals; command selectors and the complete planned search-filter matrix are confirmed in the [shared-lesson target contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract) and [#60](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/60). Implementation proceeds in working increments, and only the [active command routes](#current-increment-and-command-integration) are available today.

### Use cases

For the use cases below, the **System** is `PonHub` and the **Actor** is the tuition centre administrator.
The person, shared-lesson, attendance, search, and help operations accept all required details in one keyboard-entered command. These are target use cases; only the routes listed under [Current increment and command integration](#current-increment-and-command-integration) are active today. Canonical mutations validate and save the complete change without requiring a field prompt, preview, or separate confirmation. Read-only retrieval does not save operational data. Guided previews, capacity, make-ups and other explicitly labeled future extensions are outside the core flows.

Person selectors in these target use cases are positive indices from the current filtered people list. Resolve the selected record once to its stable ID and enforce any required Student role; another result view does not supply that index. Existing shared lessons are selected by `lid/LESSON_ID`. Creating a lesson uses a normalized full tutor name and optional exact phone; search uses partial tutor-name text.

#### UC-01: Add a person record

**Related user stories:** US-01, US-02, US-03, US-14, US-15, US-30, US-34

**Preconditions:** PonHub is running. The administrator has the person's role and required contact details.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters one `add` command containing the selected role and all required person details.
2. PonHub validates the command, normalizes the details, and checks for an exact duplicate.
3. PonHub saves one new person record, refreshes the person list, and reports success.

**Extensions**

* 1a. A required field is missing, invalid, repeated, or unsupported: PonHub explains the problem without changing data. The administrator may correct and resubmit the command at step 1.
* 2a. An exact duplicate exists: PonHub rejects the addition without changing data, and the use case ends.
* 2b. The administrator explicitly requests a planned guided preview: PonHub shows the normalized record and any possible duplicate matches before saving. The administrator cancels with no change, or confirms and resumes at step 3.
* 3a. Saving fails: PonHub rolls back the addition, reports the failure, and the use case ends.

**Postconditions:** On success, one valid, non-duplicate person record is stored and visible. Existing records are unchanged.

#### UC-02: Find and review operational records

**Related user stories:** US-04, US-05, US-06, US-16, US-17

**Preconditions:** PonHub is running with the relevant canonical records and retrieval routes integrated. Available search filters are documented for the delivered slice.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `list`, `lessons`, or one `search c/CATEGORY` command with any available filters needed.
2. PonHub validates the request and retrieves the relevant records, combining relational filters according to the same-student/same-lesson rules.
3. PonHub displays each distinct match once in the documented order, with its count and relevant relationship context. People results replace the current people filter and are numbered from one; lesson results preserve that people view.
4. To review a shared lesson, the administrator reads its stable ID from the results and enters `showlesson lid/LESSON_ID`, optionally with `d/YYYY-MM-DD` for dated attendance.
5. PonHub displays the current roster and requested dated attendance without changing operational data or the people list. For a date, missing attendance is shown as unrecorded, separately from present or absent.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator runs `lessons si/STUDENT_INDEX`: PonHub resolves the current people-list index once to a Student ID and shows that student's current lessons. An invalid index or wrong role is rejected without altering records or the people view.
* 2a. A condition is invalid, unavailable in this slice or incompatible with the category: PonHub explains the supported syntax without changing data. The administrator may resubmit at step 1.
* 3a. No record matches: PonHub displays a successful empty result, and the use case ends. Unfiltered catalogue retrieval includes shared lessons with empty rosters.
* 4a. The lesson does not exist or the date is invalid: PonHub reports the error without changing data or the people list.

**Query design:** #80 supplies the read-only catalogue, stable-ID lookup, current roster/student lessons and indexed
lesson filtering through the [prepared query backend](#indexed-lesson-query-projections-80). Current membership
comes only from Lesson-owned IDs. Own-contact people search is active; relationship search, dated roster attendance and history remain separate slices;
this use case's command/UI flow begins only once its runtime integration preconditions hold.

**Postconditions:** The requested read-only view is displayed. Operational data is unchanged; lesson and roster results preserve the current people filter, order and indices.

**Future extensions:** Sorting/grouping controls, guided search, spelling suggestions, export and saved searches belong to US-22, US-29 and US-38 to US-41. They are not steps required by this core flow and have no promised command syntax here.

#### UC-03: Create or delete an independent shared lesson

**Related user stories:** US-08, US-09, US-10, US-20

**Preconditions:** The tutor exists. PonHub has loaded the shared lesson catalogue and tutor/room bookings; compatible mutation and persistence support is integrated. Creating a lesson does not require a student.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `addlesson d/DAY st/HHMM et/HHMM s/SUBJECT tu/TUTOR_NAME [tp/TUTOR_PHONE] rm/ROOM`, supplying a full tutor name and an optional exact phone number.
2. PonHub resolves exactly one tutor by normalized full name and, when supplied, exact phone. It validates the remaining values, same-day time range and proposed slot against that tutor's bookings and room bookings.
3. PonHub saves one independent shared Lesson linked to the tutor's stable ID, allocates its stable Lesson ID, starts an empty roster, refreshes relevant views and reports success.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator instead enters `deletelesson lid/LESSON_ID`. PonHub finds that shared lesson and checks both its current roster and retained attendance references. If neither exists, it removes and saves only the lesson, releases its tutor/room booking and reports success. Surviving lesson IDs do not change; the use case ends.
* 1a1. The lesson has enrolled students or retained attendance: PonHub blocks deletion, identifies the dependency and changes nothing. It does not cascade into student or attendance deletion.
* 2a. A value is missing or invalid, or no tutor matches the full name and optional phone: PonHub explains the problem without changing the schedule. A supplied phone is never ignored to fall back to a name-only match.
* 2b. The tutor or room has an overlapping booking on that weekday: PonHub rejects the addition and identifies the conflict. Adjacent half-open intervals are allowed.
* 2c. Several tutors match the name without a disambiguating phone: PonHub rejects the command and requests `tp/TUTOR_PHONE`. The administrator checks the intended tutor's phone and resubmits the complete command. No student selector is part of lesson creation.
* 3a. Saving an addition or deletion fails: PonHub restores the complete prior data and active views, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** One clash-free shared lesson with an empty roster is stored, or one unreferenced lesson is removed. Adding a student later does not recreate the lesson or book its tutor/room again. Failed operations preserve the prior schedule and allocation state.

**Future extensions:** Lesson templates, edits, replacement tutors, one-occurrence cancellation and automatic today views are separate later requirements (US-27, US-28, US-36, US-37 and US-47).

#### UC-04: Enrol or unenrol a student in a shared lesson

**Related user stories:** US-17, US-18

**Preconditions:** The Student and shared Lesson exist. The administrator has listed or searched people and checked the intended student's current position. Canonical membership mutation and persistence support is integrated.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `enrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID` using the student's current index in the displayed filtered people list and the lesson's stable ID.
2. PonHub resolves the index once to a Student ID, validates the role and lesson, rejects duplicate membership and checks for overlap with that student's other enrolled lessons.
3. PonHub adds that Student ID to the shared lesson's roster, saves the complete change and refreshes derived student lessons and roster results without replacing the people list.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator instead enters `unenrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID`. PonHub resolves the Student once, requires current membership, removes only that membership and saves it. Dated attendance remains available; the shared lesson and student remain stored.
* 2a. The people-list index is out of range, selects another role or the lesson does not exist: PonHub explains the problem and changes nothing.
* 2b. Enrolment duplicates current membership or conflicts with the student's timetable, or unenrolment targets a non-member: PonHub rejects the change without modifying data.
* 3a. Saving fails: PonHub restores the previous aggregate and active views, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** Current membership reflects the successful command; dated attendance and stable identities are unchanged. Tutor and room bookings are still owned by the one shared lesson and are not repeated per student. Failed operations preserve prior data and views.

**Future extensions:** Capacity limits, remaining places, waiting lists, swaps and one-off make-up reservations are outside this core membership flow (US-19, US-24, US-25 and US-48).

#### UC-05: Record, correct or retrieve dated attendance

**Related user stories:** US-11, US-12, US-14, US-21

**Preconditions:** The Student and shared Lesson exist. The administrator has listed or searched people and checked the student's current people-list position. Canonical attendance and persistence support is integrated.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `mark STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID d/YYYY-MM-DD s/STATUS`, using `present` or `absent` and the student's current filtered people-list index.
2. PonHub resolves the index once to a Student ID, checks the role and validates the lesson, real date, weekday and status. A new attendance key requires current enrolment; an existing key can be corrected after unenrolment.
3. PonHub creates or updates the one record keyed by Student ID, Lesson ID and date, saves the complete change, refreshes dated attendance results and reports success. A missing record is unrecorded, not absent.

**Extensions**

* 1a. The administrator instead enters `unmark STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID d/YYYY-MM-DD`. PonHub resolves and validates the Student, lesson and date, removes only the existing dated record and saves the change. Current enrolment and the shared lesson are unchanged. Existing historical attendance can be unmarked after unenrolment.
* 1a1. No entry exists for the specified key: PonHub reports that there is nothing to unmark and changes nothing.
* 1b. The administrator enters `history STUDENT_INDEX [lid/LESSON_ID]`. PonHub resolves the Student once and displays their retained dated attendance, optionally filtered by the shared lesson. History includes former enrolments and preserves the people list. This read-only request does not save operational data.
* 2a. The index, role, lesson, date, weekday or status is invalid, or a new mark has no current membership: PonHub rejects the command and explains the problem without changing data.
* 3a. The same status already exists: PonHub reports no change and performs no operational save.
* 3b. A different status exists: PonHub corrects that key instead of adding a duplicate, including after unenrolment.
* 3c. Saving a mark or unmark fails: PonHub restores the previous aggregate and active views, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** A successful mutation stores one authoritative status for the key or removes only that key. History remains independent of current membership. Failed operations preserve attendance and views; remaining attendance references still block student and lesson deletion.

**Future extensions:** Feedback, late/excused statuses, notes, bulk/clickable attendance, percentages, make-up links and fee adjustments are not core attendance promises (US-26, US-43 to US-46, US-48 and US-49).

#### UC-06: Delete an unreferenced person

**Related user stories:** US-07

**Preconditions:** The target person exists. The administrator has listed or searched people and checked their current position; canonical guarded deletion and persistence support is integrated.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `delete INDEX` for the target in the current filtered people list.
2. PonHub validates the positive index, resolves it once to the stable person ID and checks role-specific dependencies: Student membership or attendance, or Lessons assigned to a Tutor. Deleting a separate Parent does not remove a Student's stored parent phone.
3. PonHub deletes and saves only the eligible person record, preserves the current filter, refreshes displayed positions and reports success. Surviving stable IDs and relationships remain unchanged.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The index is invalid or dependencies prevent deletion: PonHub identifies the problem and changes nothing. Linked records are never deleted automatically.
* 3a. Saving fails: PonHub restores the prior aggregate and people view, reports the failure and ends the use case.

**Postconditions:** One eligible record is deleted without broken references, or the previous state remains unchanged. Recheck displayed positions before selecting another person.

**Future extensions:** Optional previews, student archiving/restoration and undo are separate later requirements (US-23, US-31 and US-35), rather than supported alternatives to this command.

#### UC-07: Get help and recover from a command-entry error

**Related user stories:** US-13, US-32, US-33, US-42

**Preconditions:** PonHub is running and the command interface is available.

**Main success scenario**

1. The administrator enters `help` or `help COMMAND` in one command.
2. PonHub displays the command catalogue or the selected command's syntax and examples.
3. The administrator enters a complete command using the guidance.
4. PonHub validates and executes the command, then displays its result.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The administrator needs only the help catalogue: PonHub leaves the current records and selection unchanged, and the use case ends.
* 2b. Guidance exceeds the Result Display: the administrator scrolls the wrapped text and resumes at step 2.
* 2c. The administrator chooses Help from the menu or presses F1: PonHub executes the same overview help, preserving the command-box draft, filter and person selection.
* 3a. The help topic is unknown or unavailable: PonHub reports the topic and instructs the administrator to type `help` for available commands.
* 3d. More than one help topic is supplied: PonHub reports `Invalid command format!` followed by the help usage. No topic is executed.
* 3b. Required parameters are missing or invalid: PonHub shows guidance and an example without changing data. The administrator may correct and resubmit at step 3.
* 3c. The administrator uses a planned shortcut, completion, or alternative help form: PonHub maps it to the corresponding command and resumes at step 3.
* 4a. The chosen command fails for a domain-specific reason: PonHub reports the error, changes no data, and the use case ends.

**Postconditions:** The requested guidance remains visible, or the selected command has completed with clear feedback.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on Windows, Linux and macOS using Java `25`. On macOS, use the course-prescribed Azul JDK 25 with JavaFX (`25.0.3.fx-zulu`), as described in [Setting up and getting started](SettingUp.html#setting-up-the-project-on-your-computer).
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1,000 persons, 1,000 recurring lessons, and 10,000 attendance records without noticeable sluggishness during typical usage.
3.  Team performance target: common operations should update the GUI within 2 seconds on a reference machine recorded with its hardware, OS, Java version and test dataset. The reference machine and measured results are still to be documented; this guide does not claim the target has been verified.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code or system administration commands) should be able to accomplish most recurring tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The product should be for a single user and use one local data store, without requiring user accounts, concurrent access, or live synchronisation.
5.  The product should be packaged into a single executable `.jar` file and should not require an installer.
6.  The product file size should remain below 100 MB to ensure efficient storage and distribution.
7.  The GUI should display correctly and without layout issues on screen resolutions of 1920×1080 and higher at 100% and 125% scale.
8.  The GUI should remain usable (i.e. all functions remain accessible even if the layout is suboptimal) at screen resolutions of 1280×720 and higher at 150% scale.
9.  All operational data must be stored locally in a human-readable text file without using a database management system.
10. All successful data changes must be saved automatically and reliably. Failed validation or saving must leave both the in-memory data and stored data file unchanged.
11. All person, lesson, and attendance data must remain on the user's computer and must never be transmitted over the internet.
12. The application should function offline without requiring an internet connection or a team-owned remote server.
13. Invalid inputs must not crash the application or modify existing data. The application should display a specific error message explaining how the user can correct the input.
14. The application should be implemented primarily using object-oriented programming, with clear separation between the UI, Logic, Model, and Storage components.
15. Team testing target: the JUnit-based automated test suite should achieve at least 70% line coverage, and all automated tests should pass before a release. The percentage is the team's own goal, not a course-mandated minimum; coverage does not replace behavior-focused regression and integration checks.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, or macOS
* **AddressBook-Level3 (AB3)**: The upstream SE-EDU desktop application that is incrementally evolved into PonHub
* **Person record**: A stored record representing one student, tutor, or parent and containing the fields required for that role
* **Role**: The `student`, `tutor`, or `parent` category assigned to a person record, which determines its required fields and applicable operations
* **Shared recurring lesson**: An independent weekly teaching slot with a stable Lesson ID, day, start/end time, subject, tutor and room; its roster may contain zero or more Student IDs
* **Lesson occurrence**: One dated instance of a recurring lesson
* **Attendance record**: A stored record containing the attendance status of one student for one lesson occurrence
* **Attendance status**: The recorded state of a student for a lesson occurrence, such as `present` or `absent`
* **Attendance key**: The combination of student, lesson, and date that uniquely identifies one attendance record
* **Exact duplicate person**: A person record with the same role, normalised name, and identifying contact number as an existing record
* **Displayed person index**: The positive one-based position in the current filtered people list used to select a person in a command; it is distinct from a stable ID and may change when that people view is filtered or reordered. Lesson, roster and history row positions do not supply person command indices
* **Stable person ID**: The role-prefixed identity stored for a person and used in internal lookup, queries, relationships and persistence; commands resolve a displayed person index once to this identity
* **Stable lesson ID**: The `L`-prefixed identity of a shared Lesson, persisted and used in attendance references; existing lessons are selected in commands with `lid/LESSON_ID`, never a per-student lesson index
* **Tutor lookup**: Lesson creation resolves a normalized full tutor name and optional exact phone to one Tutor ID; search uses partial tutor-name text instead
* **Prefix**: A short marker in a command that identifies the type of information represented by the following value
* **Parser**: The Logic component that converts raw command text into validated parameters and a command object
* **Command**: An executable request representing one user operation in PonHub
* **Referential integrity**: The rule that prevents a record from being removed while another lesson or attendance record still refers to it
* **Atomic update**: An all-or-nothing change where either the complete operation is saved successfully or none of it is applied
* **Rollback**: The restoration of the previous valid state after an operation cannot be completed or saved
* **Human-readable data file**: The local text file used to store PonHub data in a form that can be inspected and edited without a database management system
* **Tutor clash**: An overlap between lessons assigned to the same tutor on the same day and during an overlapping time range
* **Room clash**: An overlap between lessons assigned to the same room on the same day and during an overlapping time range
* **Class**: A tuition-centre term for a shared recurring lesson; core membership uses the Lesson-owned roster, with capacity and one-off reservations deferred
* **Enrolment**: A Student's current membership in a shared Lesson; removing membership retains dated attendance
* **Roster**: The current enrolled Student IDs owned by one shared Lesson, from which displayed student records are derived
* **History**: Retained dated attendance keyed by Student ID, Lesson ID and date, independent of current membership
* **Capacity (future)**: A later limit on the number of students in a class
* **Make-up booking (future)**: A one-off reservation in a suitable class for a student who missed a regular lesson, without changing regular membership
* **Waiting list (future)**: An ordered queue of students requesting a place in a class that has reached a later capacity limit
* **Class-swap request (future)**: A pending request to move a student when a transfer cannot be completed immediately
* **Archived student (future)**: A withdrawn student retained for historical reference but hidden from the default active-student list

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Use Java 25 and the [runtime prerequisites](SettingUp.html#setting-up-the-project-on-your-computer) for these checks. On macOS, use the course-prescribed Azul JDK 25 with JavaFX (`25.0.3.fx-zulu`) for the Mac's architecture. Confirm the terminal used for `java -jar` selects that installation and record the OS, architecture and JDK distribution/version with the test results. Additional macOS trials with other distributions, including plain Oracle JDK, are optional portability checks.

### Inline help and supported routes

Use the active catalogue in the tested build; these examples apply to canonical startup.

1. In a fresh JAR folder, run `help`, then `help add`, `help addlesson`, `help enrol`, `help unenrol`, `help list`,
   `help search`, `help help` and `help exit`. Each topic matches its parser and supplies a runnable example;
   `help exit` keeps
   the app open. Repeat topic/example checks when another route is registered.
2. Add a person using a runnable `help add` example, then select its card, type an unfinished command
   and choose Help from the menu. Repeat F1 from command
   and result focus. Expect identical inline guidance, retained draft/selection and no separate window.
3. `help ADD`, `help ADDLESSON`, `help ENROL` and `help UNENROL` match their lowercase topics.
   `help remove`, `help delete` and
   `help clear` explain the unknown topic and direct users to `help`. `help add delete` reports
   invalid format and help usage.
4. At minimum width, run `help add` and scroll to the final example/back to the top. Text wraps
   readably; a new topic resets scrolling. Record actual display conditions using the
   [people-card/whole-window checks](#planned-people-card-display-checks).
5. `delete 1`, `edit 1 n/Alex`, `clear`, `find Alex` and `lessons` report `Unknown command.` without changing data.
   `list extra`, an invalid `addlesson` and `exit extra` show their relevant validation or usage messages without
   committing data, changing the list or exiting.
6. Compare operational bytes before/after help: unchanged, or still missing in a fresh folder.
   Repeat with unwritable operational storage; preference saving at shutdown remains separate.

Help checks do not establish the [planned shared-lesson workflow](#planned-shared-lesson-workflow-checks)
or final guide/site acceptance ([#102](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/102)).

### Compact windows and active contact cards

1. In an isolated working folder, launch the application on a 1280×720 display at 150% scaling and on a 1920×1080 display at 100% and 125%. Record the OS, scaling, Java version and usable desktop work area. The complete window must fit inside that work area; menu actions, command entry, results and the people list must remain reachable. Logical-size previews are useful checks, but do not replace actual platform/scaling results.
2. Resize to the minimum window size. Run `help add` and scroll to the final example. Scroll the people list to its last card. Expect separate usable result and people scrollbars, with the command box and menus still visible.
3. Add role-aware people with a long valid name, postal address and unbroken email using the active syntax, such as `add r/tutor n/Alexandra Catherine Elizabeth Montgomery Wellington p/001234567890123 e/alexandracatherineelizabethmontgomerywellington@example.com a/123 Long Residential Avenue Clementi District Block 456 Unit 12-345 Singapore 123456`. Run `list` followed by `help add` to refresh the cards, then narrow, widen and narrow the window again. Expect full values to wrap within the card without horizontal overflow; scroll vertically to reach the bottom of a tall card and the final person. Canonical add does not accept tags; inherited long-tag wrapping remains covered separately by compatibility regressions.
4. Close the application and restart with the retained preferences. Valid sizes and coordinates remain unchanged. In the isolated folder, test an oversized saved window, coordinates from a removed monitor and a still-connected monitor to the left or above the primary display. Expect an oversized/offscreen window to fit a current work area, while valid secondary-monitor coordinates remain usable.

Automated bounds regressions cover scaled work areas, desktop bars, removed and secondary monitors, partial overlap and invalid saved dimensions. Actual-FXML layout checks use isolated fixture data; they do not establish Windows or Linux font/scaling behavior. Keep real display results in issue #128.

### Planned person-index integration checks

Role-filtered listing, membership selectors and add/failure checks are active. Guarded deletion and lesson-result
parts remain planned; follow the [shared selector contract](#shared-lesson-target-contract).

1. On a mixed-role dataset, run `list`, `list r/student`, `list r/TUTOR` and `list r/parent`.
   Verify global relative order and counts; repeat with no matching records for a successful empty role.
   Reject `list r/`, `list r/all`
   and `list r/student r/parent` without changing the previous view or data.
2. Filter to Students whose stable IDs differ from positions, such as `S2`/`S5` at `1`/`2`. Exercise active
   `enrol`/`unenrol` against those current positions; position `2` must not become stable ID `S2`. Student-only
   commands reject a Tutor/Parent at a valid position and zero, negative or out-of-range indices. Once guarded
   deletion activates, apply the same selector checks to `delete`.
3. Subscribe to lesson/roster results, then use an active membership command. Verify the same people list object,
   filter/order/indices and subscribed query objects remain, with their contents refreshed. Planned `lessons si/1`
   follows the same current Student card and rejects superseded `sid/S2` input. Lesson references use `lid/`.
4. Add a person successfully: expect new record last, all-role view and refreshed positions. Trigger
   validation/save failure: expect unchanged records, allocation counters and previous people view,
   including its role filter and selected card.
   Restart with compatible data: surviving stable IDs and stored references remain intact.

<a id="planned-people-card-display-checks"></a>

### People-card display checks

Perform these checks in the active application and record the platform, build and actual result. Isolated preview
instructions are preserved in [#77](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/77).

1. Use all roles, absent/present optional contacts, leading-zero phones and long names/email/addresses.
   Verify index and stable ID are separate, role-required fields remain readable, and absent contacts
   show `Not provided`.
2. On 1280×720 at 150% and 1920×1080 at 100%/125%, resize and scroll through an entire tall card to the
   last record. Complete values must wrap without overlap or hidden content; record the actual platform,
   scaling and build. Logical preview sizes alone do not establish these results.
3. Filter/refresh the list and repeat: current positions, count and empty placeholder update correctly;
   recycled cells show the correct person. Coordinate whole-window checks with
   [#128](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/128).

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

Record the source commit, JAR SHA-256, OS/architecture and Java distribution/version for every trial.
Run `java -version` in the launch terminal and confirm the [prescribed Java 25 runtime](SettingUp.html#setting-up-the-project-on-your-computer).
Use that same terminal/runtime when reopening the JAR; substitute its actual filename if different.

<!-- Ernest used OpenAI Codex for #102's canonical startup/transaction guide reconciliation and manual evidence fields. -->

1. Build or obtain the matching `ponhub.jar`, copy it to a disposable empty JAR folder, and launch
   from that folder's terminal with Java 25: `java -jar ponhub.jar`. Expect the canonical GUI and an empty
   people view, with the initial window inside the current desktop work area. Run help/list/exit;
   `data/ponhub.json` remains absent, and preferences may save separately.
2. Relaunch, add all roles with the active examples in the UG, then exit. Expect supported JSON only after
   a successful add. Restart the same JAR and verify people, stable IDs and global creation order.
3. Resize and move the window, close it and relaunch the same JAR. Expect retained geometry from
   `preferences.json` when it fits a current screen; oversized or offscreen preferences are adjusted
   into an available desktop work area. Select a different missing path with `--data=data/another-ponhub.json`; expect an
   empty dataset and the same preference location in the JAR folder, without touching the previous
   operational file. Launch the JAR from another working directory and confirm data/preferences/logs
   still remain in the JAR folder. Repeat the actual resolution/scaling changes in
   [#128](https://github.com/AY2627S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/issues/128), recording the tested build,
   each setting and outcome, including settings unavailable on the test platform.
4. Repeat with `java -jar ponhub.jar --data="separate store/ponhub.json"`. Confirm the status footer and
   subsequent successful save/reload use that selected path. Keep a legacy `data/addressbook.json` in the
   JAR folder and verify default startup/add/exit leaves its bytes unchanged. Reject blank `--data=`,
   `../outside.json`, an absolute path outside the JAR folder and a symbolic-link escape before any
   operational read/write outside application home.

`ApplicationStartupTest` exercises production `MainApp.init()` and `stop()` in isolated JVM folders
whose paths contain spaces, with real JavaFX named parameters. It verifies empty missing-store startup,
legacy/corrupt/unsupported rejection, supported human edits and allocation validation, original-byte
preservation through help/list/exit and rejected mutations, repaired restart, alternate paths and shared
GUI preference reload. The JavaFX toolkit starts, but its test-only start callback displays no window;
these checks do not establish native interaction or physical display/scaling acceptance. Development
classes resolve application home from each child working directory; repeat the packaged JAR procedure
above to verify the JAR-folder boundary independently. Ernest used OpenAI Codex for these regression
tests and their current-runtime guide reconciliation.

### Canonical people commands and unsuccessful saves

1. Add a Tutor, Student and Parent, omitting optional Student contacts. Add a second student with the
   same parent phone and a different name. Expect distinct stable IDs, readable role-specific cards and
   the global creation order after restart. Run `list r/student`, `list r/TUTOR` and `list r/parent`;
   positions renumber from one while stored IDs and relative order remain unchanged.
2. Select a Student card after role filtering. Try a duplicate Student with the same normalized name
   and parent phone, a missing required field, unknown/repeated prefixes, and a Tutor with `l/`. Expect
   rejection and unchanged file bytes, records, counters, filter and selection. Reject `list r/all`,
   `list r/` and two role prefixes without changing the previous view. A valid empty role result succeeds.
3. Use a disposable save-failure setup: retain the pre-command file and make the operational location
   unwritable for the app account, or use the automated failing-writer seam. Attempt a valid addition;
   expect no success message, publication or ID consumption. Restore access and retry. The successful
   record uses the next unconsumed ID and appears last in the all-role view; restart verifies persistence.
4. With a selected card, request help from the menu/F1 and through the command box. Expect preserved
   records/filter/selection; menu/F1 additionally retain unfinished text. Run unavailable delete and lesson-result
   commands; expect unknown-command feedback. Lesson/relationship searches
   give explicit interim feedback. These failures preserve data, filter and selection.

### Active own-contact search checks

1. With mixed roles and unlinked records, run `search c/student`, `search c/tutor` and `search c/parent` after a
   different role listing. Match the full catalogue in creation order, once per stable ID, with positions from 1.
2. Combine all student own-fields: `search c/student n/Alex l/S2 p/00012345 pp/00123456 e/@example a/main road`.
   Check case/repeated-space normalization, exact phones including zeros, absent optional values and zero results.
   Resolve the next person selector against this visible view; its position must not become an ID suffix.
3. Switch between two same-role searches, then `list r/student` and `list`. Each listing clears the search criteria.
   `help search`, Help menu and F1 preserve the filtered view; compare operational bytes before/after read commands.
4. Reject `search c/student d/Mon`, `search c/parent sn/Alex` and `search c/lesson` with explicit interim feedback.
   Unknown/repeated/blank/category-incompatible fields fail without replacing the previous people view.
5. Attempt an addition with a failed-save destination while a search is active. Retain data, counters, bytes,
   filter and selected card. Restore access and retry; success saves before resetting to all roles. Reopen the file
   to verify persistence. Search criteria are session view state, not stored operational data.
6. With a compound own-contact search active, create a shared lesson using an existing tutor's full name and
   optional exact phone. Success saves an empty-roster lesson and refreshes lesson queries while preserving the
   complete people search and its indices. Repeat with a failing writer: records, counters, bytes, people search
   and lesson projections stay unchanged. Restore writing and retry; the same next Lesson ID is allocated.

### Active shared-lesson membership checks

1. In an isolated supported dataset, add two Tutors and two Students, then create overlapping lessons using
   different Tutors and rooms, an adjacent lesson, and an equal-time lesson on another weekday. Keep the returned
   Lesson IDs. Arrange for one Student's stable ID to differ from their current filtered-list position.
2. Run `search c/student`, note the intended Student's current position, and enter
   `enrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID`. Expect feedback naming the resolved Student ID and Lesson ID. Verify one
   roster membership, no new Lesson/tutor/room booking, unchanged people filter/order/positions, refreshed existing
   roster/student-lesson query lists, persisted membership after restart, and no attendance changes.
3. Against clean copies, reject a Tutor/Parent position, an out-of-range position, a missing Lesson ID, duplicate
   enrolment and a Student timetable overlap. Reject malformed, repeated, unknown and misordered arguments. Each
   rejection must preserve aggregate state, file bytes, current people view and subscribed lesson results.
4. Enrol the Student in the adjacent and different-weekday lessons; both must succeed. Enrol a second Student in
   the same shared lesson; its Lesson ID, tutor, room and schedule remain single canonical values.
5. With dated attendance already stored, enter `unenrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/LESSON_ID`. Verify only current roster
   membership is removed, attendance and both records remain, query lists refresh, and restart matches. Repeating
   `unenrol` reports that the Student is not enrolled and makes no change.
6. Inject a save failure for a valid membership change. Expect no success feedback, publication or file change;
   data, attendance, filters, positions and observable query objects/contents remain unchanged. Restore writing and
   retry the same command; it commits once and reloads identically.

### Contact validation in the current increment

Use role-aware commands in a disposable selected data file.

1. Enter `add r/tutor n/  Anne-Marie   O'Neil  p/00123456 e/anne%school@example.com a/  Blk 10,   #01-02  `.
   Expect normalized name `Anne-Marie O'Neil` and address `Blk 10, #01-02`, retaining punctuation,
   email and phone zeros. Restart: the saved values remain intact.
2. Try `add r/tutor n/Test User p/1234567890123456 e/test@example.com a/Blk 10`, then
   `add r/tutor n/Test User p/123 e/test@localhost a/Blk 10`. Expect the relevant phone/email constraints
   and no addition. Likewise reject `n/Test2 User` and `a/Blk 10/Unit 2` in otherwise valid role-aware input.
3. Paste an email consisting of 5,000 `a.` repetitions followed by `a@example.com` into otherwise valid
   add input. Expect email constraints without a crash or saved contact.
4. In separate copies of supported JSON, introduce an invalid contact or same-role records with the
   same identifying phone and names `Alex  Tan`/`Alex Tan`, becoming duplicates after normalization.
   Expect protected startup and original bytes preserved through help/list/exit and attempted mutations.
   Use the [Storage recovery procedure](#current-protected-startup) on a deliberately corrected working copy.

### Planned guarded deletion

`delete` is unavailable in this build. Once the guarded route activates, test current people-list
selection, index/range/role validation and all relationship guards from the shared contract. Until then,
`delete`, `delete 1` and `help delete` must not expose the inherited unguarded deletion implementation.

### Planned shared-lesson workflow checks

Run these as the corresponding routes become available, using an isolated supported dataset. They verify the broader target rather than adding a complete-workflow requirement to every Week 8 PR.

1. Add one Tutor and two Students, then create one lesson with the active command
   `addlesson d/Mon st/1600 et/1730 s/Math tu/FULL_NAME tp/EXACT_PHONE rm/R1`, replacing the tutor placeholders
   with the added tutor's values. Expect a new stable Lesson ID and an empty roster in the saved snapshot; restart
   and verify the same record. Once the catalogue route is active, it must show that lesson once. Substitute the
   actual returned Lesson ID for `L1` in every later `lid/` argument.
2. Run `list r/student`, check both current positions and use them in `enrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1`. Both students must refer to the same Lesson ID; the tutor and room booking must still exist only once. Check student clashes separately from global tutor/room clashes, including adjacent times.
3. Keep that people view while running `lessons`, `lessons si/STUDENT_INDEX` and `showlesson lid/L1`. Verify the people filter/order/indices remain unchanged. A roster position must not be reinterpreted as a people-list selector.
4. For each student, mark Monday `2026-10-05` with `mark STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1 d/2026-10-05 s/present` or `s/absent`. Verify one record per student/lesson/date, same-status no-op, correction and explicit unrecorded display for another Monday without a mark.
5. Unenrol one student using `unenrol STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1`. `history STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1` must retain their record. Correction and `unmark STUDENT_INDEX lid/L1 d/2026-10-05` must work for that existing key; a new mark without membership must be rejected. Check Student and Lesson deletion guards before and after removing their remaining dependencies.
6. Exercise each activated search filter from the full matrix, including a parent with two linked children and a student with two differently scheduled lessons. Combined filters must not take the name from one child and the lesson from another, or the day from one lesson and the subject from another. Verify distinct-ID counts, successful empty results and empty-lesson discovery when appropriate.
7. Restart and verify IDs, global creation order, membership and retained attendance. Trigger a save failure in an isolated test seam and verify the aggregate, allocation state and active views are restored. Read-only list/query/history/help operations must not rewrite operational data in the integrated runtime. Record the actual build, platform and results; do not treat unperformed checks as passes.

<a id="planned-canonical-loading-and-recovery"></a>

### Canonical loading and recovery

These checks apply to the active selected-file loading boundary. Use copies in disposable test folders and keep the preserved original and backup outside all configured operational paths.

1. In a deliberately separate empty folder, launch the canonical build with no operational file. Expect a valid empty unwritten root and no file after help/list/exit. Add delivered records and restart; expect successful restoration. This does not authorize replacing a legacy or rejected file in an existing folder.
2. Close the app and make a valid manual edit to supported versioned JSON using its delivered schema, such as correcting a contact value while preserving valid IDs, allocation state and references. Restart; expect the edited records to load. Repeat with valid supported lessons/memberships. Repeat with valid dated history, including a student no longer in the lesson roster. Human editing must remain usable.
3. In independent copies, test malformed JSON, a null root/record, wrong record shapes, duplicate IDs or normalized duplicate people, dangling lesson/roster references, invalid allocation state, unreadable files and unsupported versions. Test duplicate attendance keys, missing references, invalid dates/statuses and lesson weekday mismatch. Even a future-version file resembling legacy `persons` must be rejected before domain decoding or any write. Expect a controlled diagnostic and recovery instructions rather than a crash.
4. Capture each rejected file's bytes, then attempt help/list/exit and a data mutation wherever the failure state permits them. The rejected operational bytes must remain identical, and mutations must be blocked. The app must show a protected empty view with recovery guidance; help advertises only help/list/exit and list includes the diagnostic. Preferences are checked separately. Repair or remove a working copy while the app remains open; add must stay blocked until restart.
5. Test an unversioned AB3 file and formerly accepted contacts rejected by #61. Expect no guessed roles, silent conversion, record dropping or empty writable fallback. Follow the backup/manual re-entry guidance using a separate missing `--data=PATH` inside application home or a JAR copied into a separate empty folder with explicitly chosen roles. Verify only the new supported root is writable and that the old file and preserved backup remain unchanged.
6. Correct an invalid supported file on a working copy while the app is closed, then restart and verify complete validation succeeds. If recovery uses an older build for inspection, use another working copy rather than the preserved original or backup. Record actual outcomes for the implemented UG/DG recovery path; no importer or recovery command is assumed.


<a id="prepared-canonical-transaction-handoff-82"></a>

### Canonical transaction boundary (#82)

`PeopleView.beginTransaction()` creates a `CanonicalTransaction` from the view's own canonical root,
so staged person-index resolution and staged operational data share one source. It copies the current
role filter and retains the complete immutable `PonHubDataState`, including deleted-ID allocation
history, exhaustion, lesson rosters and retained attendance. Operational equality includes counters.

`CanonicalCommandExecutor` accepts that live view, a complete snapshot writer, and the authoritative
protected-session error supplier. A staged command receives only the working aggregate and working
view. Resolve a displayed index once with `PersonIndexResolver`, prepare changes (for example with
`PersonAdditionCandidate`), and set the staged filter as needed. The executor saves changed state
before installing it or returning success. Failures never refresh the live list; successful publication
refreshes its existing observable projection. Unchanged data skips storage, and unchanged views are
not refreshed, preserving selection for help/history and identical-status no-ops.

The active canonical session invokes this boundary over its one live root. It supplies the protected
writer and session error supplier and enforces the help/list/exit-only catalogue before dispatch after
a rejected load. The guard also rejects staged operational changes while loading is protected.
`JsonPonHubDataStorage` remains behind that protected adapter. The codec supports lessons, rosters and retained
attendance. Never strip historical attendance to save.

Regression tests exercise the real aggregate, addition candidate, filtered view, people codec/reload,
failed-save retry without consuming an ID, retained attendance, roster changes, protected writes,
invalid attendance rejection, and JavaFX card selection at filtered index 1 with stable ID S7.
The active application router uses these components through its single session. Component regressions
support application verification but do not establish unperformed native display/platform results.


<a id="prepared-protected-canonical-loading-84"></a>

### Protected canonical loading (#84)

`ProtectedPonHubDataStorage` wraps the canonical codec and file writer for one application session.
Construct it with the configured operational `Path` and call `load()` once before building the canonical
model. Only confirmed absence returns a fresh unwritten root. Supported input must pass the version
classifier and full validation in the canonical codec before any snapshot is returned. Rejection status
separates unreadable, corrupt, unsupported-version and legacy data. Unrelated programming failures are
not reclassified as corrupt user files. Uninitialized sessions cannot write either.

A rejected load throws `DataLoadingException`, records actionable path-specific guidance and blocks
`saveData()` for the entire session. Neither external repair nor deletion unlocks that instance; restart
with a new storage instance to validate recovery. No rejected snapshot is installed and no fallback
empty state is returned. If the UI shows an empty protected view, label it as unavailable saved data.
Preferences keep their existing separate storage/shutdown lifecycle.

The active session installs the returned snapshot in its single root, passes `storage::saveData` and
`storage::getDataLoadError` to `CanonicalCommandExecutor`, and enforces help/list/exit-only routing after
rejected startup. `MainApp` connects that session, canonical cards and routing together.
Do not point the legacy runtime at canonical data or bypass protection via `JsonPonHubDataStorage`.
The wrapper delegates domain validation to the codec, including attendance field parsing and aggregate
reference, duplicate-key and weekday checks, without introducing another writable store.

Verification includes missing paths, injected access denial, malformed/null/legacy/unsupported input,
duplicate identities and invalid allocation history, no overwrite through direct saves or the canonical
command boundary, and restart-only recovery after deliberate supported edits. Canonical session tests exercise actual add/list/search/help/exit routing. Application startup, configured-path,
UI/card and packaged platform checks additionally verify the cutover; retained legacy regressions remain
isolated and do not establish canonical application acceptance. For manual verification, use disposable files, record their original
bytes, attempt reads and mutations in the protected session, repair a copy, restart and verify successful
loading. Never delete the original as a recovery shortcut.


### Retained attendance persistence (#83)

The version-1 root stores `attendance` as an ordered array independent of lesson rosters:

```json
"attendance": [
  {"studentId": "S1", "lessonId": "L2", "date": "2026-10-12", "status": "present"}
]
```

All four fields are required strings; unknown fields are rejected. Dates must be real calendar dates
in `YYYY-MM-DD` form (years 0001–9999) and match the referenced lesson's weekday. Status accepts
`present` or `absent`, ignoring case and surrounding whitespace, and is saved in lowercase.
The Student and Lesson must exist, but the Student need not remain enrolled. Duplicate
`(studentId, lessonId, date)` keys are rejected, including duplicates with different statuses.
A correction replaces the status at one key; removal omits only that key. Neither changes membership.

`PonHubDataState` validates references, uniqueness, date range and weekday before publication;
`JsonPonHubDataCodec` validates JSON shapes and parses fields before constructing that snapshot.
The existing protected loader and staged save boundary persist the entire aggregate without a second store.
`JsonAttendanceStorageTest` covers shared lessons, retained history after roster removal, corrections,
single-key removal, complete snapshot equality and rejected input preserving disk and live state.
These persistence tests do not activate the planned mark/unmark commands.
